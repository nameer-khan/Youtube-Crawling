Peach and Berry Summer Pudding
RECIPE COURTESY OF INA GARTEN
Level: Easy
Total: 8 hr 35 min (includes chilling time)
Active: 35 min
Yield: 8 servings

Ingredients

1 pint fresh strawberries, hulled and sliced
1 1/2 cups sugar
3 half-pints fresh raspberries, divided
2 half-pints fresh blueberries
1 pound peaches, peeled and 1/2-inch diced
2 tablespoons framboise (raspberry brandy)
1 loaf brioche or egg bread (1 to 1 1/2 pounds)
Whipped Cream, for serving (recipe follows)

Whipped Cream:
1 cup cold heavy cream
3 tablespoons sugar
1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

Directions

Combine the strawberries, sugar, and 1/4 cup of water in a large saucepan and cook uncovered over medium-low heat for 5 minutes. Add 2 half-pints of the raspberries and all of the blueberries and peaches and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reaches a simmer. Simmer for 1 minute. Off the heat, stir in the remaining raspberries and the framboise.

Slice the bread into 1/2-inch-thick slices and remove the crusts. In the bottom of a 7 1/2-inch round by 3-inch high souffl√© or baking dish, ladle about 1/2 cup of the cooked fruit mixture. Arrange slices of bread on top in a pattern (this will become the top when the pudding is unmolded) and then add more fruit mixture to saturate. 
Continue adding bread, cutting it to fit the mold, and fruit. Finish with bread and cooked fruit, using all of the fruit and syrup.

Place a sheet of plastic wrap loosely over the pudding. Find a plate approximately the same diameter as the inside of the mold and place it on top. Weight the mold with a heavy can and refrigerate overnight.

Just before serving, run a knife around the outside of the pudding and unmold it upside down onto a serving plate. Serve in wedges with whipped cream.

Whipped Cream:
Whip the cream in the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment. When it starts to thicken, add the sugar and vanilla. Continue to whip until it forms stiff peaks. Serve cold.

How do bloggers make money?

I love, absolutely love reading about success stores of people starting a website, putting in the hard work for years and building wealth for themselves while producing a lot of value for everyone else.

This video is based of this Reddit post: 
The website in question is: 

Practical Wanderlust is a site that knows what it is. Practical travel advice, a little bit of story telling and a whole lot of work to make travel content that is insanely helpful. In the post she breaks down how she make money from blogging.

As someone who loves to travel, I sincerely appreciate the design and work ethic she has put into her blog. Anyways, enjoy the video :)

How do bloggers make money from blogging?

Her main sources of income are advertising at over 3k a month as well as professional writing gigs at 3k a month. This is followed up by affiliate marketing for another 3k. Of this affiliate marketing, about half is from Amazon and the other half are various other programs.

The Mughal Empire (also referred to as Baburid Empire, Baburid Dynasty) was founded by Zahiriddin Muhammad Babur, a Timurid prince and ruler from Turan or Turkistan, i.e. Central Asia (Uzbekistan). Babur was a direct descendant to the Turkic Emperor Timur on his father's side and also had links to Chagatai, the second son of the Mongol ruler Genghis Khan, on his mother‚Äôs side.Ousted from his ancestral domains in Turkistan by Sheybani Khan, the 14-year old Prince Babur turned to India to satisfy his ambitions. He established himself in Kabul and then pushed steadily southward into India from Afghanistan through the Khyber Pass. Babur's forces occupied much of northern India after his victory at Panipat in 1526. The preoccupation with wars and military campaigns, however, did not allow the new emperor to consolidate the gains he had made in India.The instability of the empire became evident under his son, Humayun, who was driven out of India and into Persia by rebels.Humayun's exile in Persia established diplomatic ties between the Safavid and Mughal Courts, and led to increasing West Asian cultural influence in the Mughal court. The restoration of Mughal rule began after Humayun‚Äôs triumphant return from Persia in 1555, but he died from a fatal accident shortly afterwards.Humayun's son, Akbar, succeeded to the throne under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped consolidate the Mughal Empire in India.

Through warfare and diplomacy, Akbar was able to extend the empire in all directions, and controlled almost the entire Indian subcontinent north of the Godavari river. He created a new class of nobility loyal to him from the military aristocracy of India's social groups, implemented a modern government and supported cultural developments. At the same time Akbar intensified trade with European trading companies. The Indian historian Abraham Eraly wrote that foreigners were often impressed by the fabulous wealth of the Mughal court, but the glittering court hid darker realities, namely that about a quarter of the empire's gross national product was owned by 655 families while the bulk of India's 120 million people lived in appalling poverty.After suffering what appears to have been an epileptic seizure in 1578 while hunting tigers, which he regarded as a religious experience, Akbar grew disenchanted with Islam, and came to embrace a syncretistic mixture of Hinduism and Islam.Akbar allowed free expression of religion and attempted to resolve socio-political and cultural differences in his empire by establishing a new religion, Din-i-Ilahi, with strong characteristics of a ruler cult. He left his successors an internally stable state, which was in the midst of its golden age, but before long signs of political weakness would emerge. Akbar's son, Jahangir, ruled the empire at its peak, but he was addicted to opium, neglected the affairs of the state, and came under the influence of rival court cliques. During the reign of Jahangir's son, Shah Jahan, the culture and splendour of the luxurious Mughal court reached its zenith as exemplified by the Taj Mahal.The maintenance of the court, at this time, began to cost more than the revenue

I've been a full-time blogger / travel vlogger for 9 years and transformed myself into a full-time travel blogger in the past 3 years. I will teach you how to create a website, build a brand and get you setup on the path to getting paid to travel. When I first started out in 2016, I didn't have a clue about how to take a decent photo and forget about shooting video. Today, I'm proud to say I'm halfway decent as a photographer and videographer and have racked up 800k followers on social and 1.5 million views on YouTube.

// How Much Money Can You Make As a Travel Blogger?

Since starting my travel influencer account, I've earned more than $200,000 from a combination of affiliate commission, paid sponsors, adsense and selling my own products. This is definitely a career that if you work hard and build yourself up, you can easily quit your job and live your dreams.

// How to Make a Blog [2019] Focused on Travel Blogging

My advice for any new website is to use Wordpress. First of all, it's free, unlike SquareSpace which costs money to use and locks you into their hosting provider. With a Wordpress website, you can move it to any hosting provider (whether it be Bluehost or Hostgator when you first start out) or WPEngine when you really grow your blog and have a ton of traffic.

// How to Start a Blog and Become a Full Time Blogger

Setting up your first website should take no more than 15 minutes. Your steps are:

Pick your domain name
Sign up for your hosting plan
Install Wordpress
Install your theme
Start blogging
Setup your blog here for just $3.95:

// How to Write a Travel Blog

The really daunting task is shooting good photos and videos and telling stories as a travel blogger. I started out blogging not knowing a thing about how to shoot photos or videos but thanks to Youtube, I was able to teach myself everything I needed to learn. I suggest you do the same thing, start searching on YouTube and teach yourself.

In this video, I walk you through exactly what my steps are to starting and making money with your own travel blog.

I‚Äôve tried almost every possible Monetization strategy and these are my proven methods that work for me:

Affiliate marketing where you get paid a commission for selling something
Paid advertisements like Crest paying me to review their white strips
Adsense revenue which I get from people watching this video and clicking on ads on my website
Freelancing: taking photos, building websites or providing consulting to small businesses
Selling a product: I have a style guide I created last year and it sells a couple of copies every month

// my proven techniques as a full time travel blogger

// find your speciality
- Say you want to be a travel blogger, what‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôll bring on every trip that everyone needs? A great bag. Imagine you took a different bag on every trip and reviewed it as part of the vlog. I guarantee you‚Äôd be one of the few experts reviewing just bags and you‚Äôd be able to corner the market. And when you do your videos, it would be really hard for someone like me or anyone else to copy your knowledge base and expertise
- Besides travel bags you could also focus on bug spray, sunscreen, backup batteries, etc find something you‚Äôre interested in and own it

// This will be hard, but follow these tips to ensure you succeed

UlRyQwcSvm8,Freedom From Choice (Government Corruption) | History Documentary | Reel Truth History,"Life is about choice. What we eat, what we read, who we elect; every day we make choices that determine how we want to live.

But what if these choices are just an illusion?

In an era where regulations and red tape rule every industry, where lobby groups and big business wield more influence than ever before, our daily choices have become increasingly limited. And with all our options so deliberately handpicked, are we really making a choice at all?

Freedom From Choice examines the current state of life and personal choice today. Experts from many different fields offer a frank and startling look at the hidden limitations in our daily lives. Focusing on key areas such as food, medicine, finance, and media, Freedom From Choice provides viewers with a glimpse at the myriad of ways their lives are being dictated, and tells us who stands to gain.

HyjLt_RGE,The History of Writing - Where the Story Begins - Extra History,"How did the ancient civilization of Sumer first develop the concept of the written word? It all began with simple warehouse tallies in the temples, but as the scribes sought more simple ways to record information, those tallies gradually evolved from pictograms into cuneiform text which could be used to convey complex, abstract, or even lyrical ideas.

____________

Sumer was the land of the first real cities, and those cities required complex administration. The temples which kept people together were not only religious places, but also warehouses which stored the community's collective wealth until it was needed to get through lean years. As the donations came in, scribes would count the items and draw pictures of them on clay tablets. The images quickly became abstract as the scribes needed to rush, and they also morphed to represent not just an image but the word itself - more specifically, the sound of the word, which meant that it could also be written to represent other words that sounded similar (homophones). Sumerian language often put words together to express new ideas, and the same concept applied to their writing. As people came to use this system more, the scribes began to write from left to right instead of top to bottom since they were less likely to mess up their clay tablets that way. Those who read the tablets didn't appreciate this change, so the scribes rotated the words 90 degrees allowing tablets to be rotated if the reader preferred - but this made the images even more abstract, until eventually the pictograms vanished entirely to be replaced by wedge-shaped stylus marks: cuneiform. Many of Sumer's neighbors adopted this invention and helped it spread throughout the region, though completely different writing systems developed independently in cultures situated in places like China and South America!

Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be.

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

MRI8ffYKA8,Vienna Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Vienna.d17831...

On your next trip to Austria, pay a visit to its capital city of Vienna. During the late 19th and early 20th century, this city became a cultural epicenter of Europe, contributing art, philosophy, and culture on its way to becoming one of the world‚Äôs great cities.

During your Vienna sightseeing, you can drink coffee in the same cafes as Einstein and Freud, or wander down the streets that inspired Beethoven. Tour galleries devoted to some of the most magnificent artwork in all of Europe, then walk along the Ringstrasse. Also called ‚ÄúRing Road,‚Äù this downtown boulevard home to private residences, palaces, and other exquisite examples of architecture for you to marvel at. 

Much of Vienna tourism is centered in its cafes. This is not just because its residents love strong coffee‚Äîthough they do‚Äîbut because Viennese social life largely grows out of its coffee houses. Locals will spend hours at their favorite cafes, reading the paper, speaking to friends, working on projects, or listening to music in the evenings. Sit at a table and watch the people of Vienna stroll by, or enjoy a sachertorte, or chocolate cake, while catching up on your latest novel. It‚Äôs impossible to visit this city and not be inspired.

Vienna has long been called The City of Music. Find out why at the Vienna State Opera; a backstage tour will show you all the ins and outs of this majestic place, as well as give you a glimpse of why it has been at the forefront of entertainment since its construction in the 1800s. Afterward, head a few blocks south to the Volksgarten, or people‚Äôs garden. Stroll through its pathways and sniff the sweet fragrance of its hundreds of roses. What better way to end a day in one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful cities? 

What was your favorite part of Vienna?

Nobody Showed You the History Of India Like This

This is India! Just look how beautiful, magical and spiritual this place is. Green trees, deep blue rivers, hot shining sun‚Ä¶ India. Are you ready to travel back in time again? Buckle up because it‚Äôs going to be a long rough ride! 

Once upon a time, or to be more accurate, around 70,000 years ago people in Africa decided that they got tired of living with angry hungry neighbors aka hungry animals. They left the continent and reached India. It was a long hard way. The scientists will later call it the coastal migration. Yep, they have a word for everything. 

They didn‚Äôt stand idly by. They beginning to learn the surroundings and by 6,500 BC began farming. They also raised cattle, goats, and sheep. Water buffalo were used to pull carts. Guys, now that we have food, let‚Äôs created something to store it in. By 5,500 BC they intended and widely used pottery. Well done people.

Transcript:

You're joining me in a very special city. Let‚Äôs start with my preconceptions: I expected Japan‚Äôs capital, and home to the world‚Äôs largest urban population to be over the top and really in your face, with neon lights and anime at every turn and i certainly wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The streets are lined with towering, multi-storey buildings, each filled with mind bending department stores and arcades, offices to some of the world‚Äôs biggest brands and restaurants serving the best food you‚Äôll ever taste.

But despite all the apparent madness and chaos, spend a few days in Tokyo and it just makes sense. Here, efficiency is an art form. Japanese attention to detail is legendary, and it runs through everything, from food to public transport and urban planning. And yes, even the toilets. 

This trip was an educational and weirdly enlightening experience. I‚Äôve been lucky to visit a lot of amazing places making these videos, but Tokyo is in a league of its own.

So Tokyo, it‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs busy and it‚Äôs brilliant. As ever, let‚Äôs start with the airports.

Flying from the UK you‚Äôll come into one of Tokyo‚Äôs two major international airports, Haneda or Narita. Of course, you don‚Äôt need me to tell you that Tokyo is a really long way away, direct flights from Europe will take a whopping 12 hours for the nine and a half thousand kilometre journey.

So you‚Äôve got Haneda airport which is roughly 13 miles south of the city, and then you‚Äôve got 50 miles east. Fortunately, both are really easy to get to noisy noisy Tokyo. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.

From Haneda you have three main options, the airport limousine bus, a taxi or the monorail. The airport limousine takes between 30 and 45 minutes, stopping at most major hotels in the centre of town, with prices increasing for the night service between midnight and 5am.

A taxi should take about half and hour depending on traffic, with prices depending where you‚Äôre being dropped off. There‚Äôs also a 20% extra charge between 10pm and 5am.

However the quickest option is the airport‚Äôs dedicated monorail. It‚Äôll get you into Hamamatsucho station in 13 minutes and from here you can connect to the circular Yamanote metro line to reach other parts of the city. 

The metro runs between 9 and 7 on weekdays and then 9 to 5 on weekends and public holidays. That‚Äôs Haneda! Here‚Äôs what you need to know about Narita.

Narita is a whopping 50 miles east of Tokyo, so all of your transport options are going to take a while. The Airport Limousine bus and taxis runs from Narita but both will take anywhere between 90 minutes to 2 hours to reach central Tokyo. Instead, take the JR Narita Express. It‚Äôll whisk into town in a little under an hour, and with this being Japan, the trains are on time and super efficient.

A word of warning about getting home; if you‚Äôre flight‚Äôs on a Sunday, make sure you check the train times because there‚Äôs a reduced service. Check your departure time, and then allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport.",travel blogs

¬ª THE TRADITIONAL FOOD IN MADAGASCAR

1. TSENA‚ÄôNY TANTSAHA TALATAMATY: Rice Porridge + Chinese Noodle Soup
ADDRESS: Talatamaty City  
OPEN: 3AM - 7AM (or whenever the police shut it down) 

Four miles outside of Madagascar‚Äôs capital city, Antananarivo, lies Talatamaty City. Talatamaty City is home to one of the country‚Äôs largest local morning markets, Tsena‚Äôny Tantsaha. Sellers open up shop at 3am, selling everything from produce to fabrics. And lucky for us, the market has no shortage of food to try as well. 

ü•£RICE PORRIDGE: Zebu (Malagasy cattle) and sausage are mixed with leaves, ginger, special Malagasy rice, porridge and spices. 

ü•°CHINESE NOODLE DISH: Pasta, macaroni, potato, mayonnaise and zebu skin. 
----
2. TALATA VOLON‚ÄôONDRY: Sausage + Koba
ADDRESS: Talata Volon‚Äôondry 
OPEN: Varies 

Talata Volon‚Äôondry is a village located just outside of Antananarivo. The village is known for producing sausage and Madagascar‚Äôs national snack, koba. 

ü•îSAUSAGE: There are typically two types of sausage being sold - zebu sausage and a halal style potato sausage. This snack is frequently accompanied by local rum. 

üá≤üá¨KOBA: Lay out banana leaf spines with banana leaves on top. Add a layer of rice flour to prevent the koba mixture from sticking to the banana leaves. Then add the koba mixture, a combination of crushed raw peanuts and sugar. Wrap it all up in the banana leaves and allow it to cook in a bit of water for 3 days. 

Koba is beloved across Madagascar, primarily sold on the street or to people in their cars as they drive through a city. The fuel from the ingredients gives people energy and helps them stay full even when walking long distances without and source of food along the way.
üí∏PRICE: Sausage .14 USD/500 MGA | Koba .50 USD/1,756 MGA

Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences.

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

x5QRIDwQo3,Gov't announces plans to boost manufacturing sector,"ÏÇ∞ÏóÖÎ∂Ä, Ï†úÏ°∞ÏóÖ Î•¥ÎÑ§ÏÉÅÏä§ ÎπÑÏ†Ñ Î∞è Ï†ÑÎûµ Î∞úÌëú

The trade ministry has announced details of its own... on measures to revitalize the country's manufacturing sector,... aimed at transforming South Korea into the world's fourth-largest exporter. 
Kim Hyesung reports. 
Restructuring existing industries, finding new growth engines, nurturing talent and attracting more investment.
That's the government's plan to boost its manufacturing sector,... which accounts for nearly a third of the country's GDP,... but is hobbled by its stagnant automobile and shipbuilding industries,... and a lack of new businesses to drive future growth. 
The government's goal is to raise the proportion of value-added industries in manufacturing... from the current 25 percent... to the OECD average of around 30 percent. 
To nurture new industries and develop new products,... the government will push for structural changes... by introducing more smart factories, as well as AI and robots. 
In particular, the government will invest over seven billion US dollars in three new industries... including future cars, non-memory chips, and biotech.
This will be backed up by private sector investment of more than 153 billion US dollars... by the year 2030. 
""To push for qualitative growth in manufacturing amid fiercer global competition, government support and investment is important. But with convergence between manufacturing, services and IT becoming the new trend in the Fourth Industrial Revolution, easing regulations in Korea is actually more important to boost innovation.""
In fact, the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry's poll on 500 local manufacturing firms Tuesday... shows that two out of three surveyed... haven't found new businesses to drive sustainable future growth.
They are also losing competitiveness,... caught in between firms from advanced countries and emerging economies.

UAgfy-fILk,Why Artists Don't Make Money - The Business of Life (Episode 3),"This episode of 'The Business of Life' looks at two creative industries going in seemingly opposite trajectories: the fine art world, where the sky is seemingly the limit for the prices collectors are willing to pay; and the music industry, where the free-fall of record company profits has only recently begun to slow.

But at the root of each sector‚Äôs rising or declining fortunes is the underlying question: How should we compensate artists? And what value do cultural products create in a society? To get to the bottom of the issue, we‚Äôve tapped the former New Yorker pop critic Sasha Frere-Jones, award-winning artist Ryder Ripps, and Glenn O‚ÄôBrien, the founder of TV Party, original editor of Interview Magazine, and a former member of Andy Warhol‚Äôs Factory.

‚ñ∫T-shirts - https://migrationology.com/store/

We had one full day in Zurich, Switzerland, and I wanted to make the most of it by going on a Swiss food tour, eating as much food as possible, and walking around and seeing some of the most famou sights and attractions in the beautiful city of Zurich.

Here are all the details about everything you‚Äôll find in this video:

Z√ºrich, Switzerland

Caf√© Henrici - To begin the day for Swiss breakfast, we stopped to have a cup of coffee, and also I wanted a croissant, but they were all out of the morning already, so I settled for a few small slices of bread. It was excellent.
Total price for 3 people - 24.40 CHF ($25.75)

Lindenhof Hill - This is a great place to get a view over Old Zurich, and it puts the city into perspective and helps you get your bearings, and the views are beautiful.

Swiss Chuchi - Thank you to Marcel for this recommendation. In Switzerland for a single day, I needed to eat one of the most well known of all Swiss food, cheese fondue. At Swiss Chuchi restaurant, we enjoyed both cheese fondue and raclette, both of which were excellent and the most cheese I‚Äôve had in a  single meal in a very long time.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)
That included all I ate, and 2 other plates  of food.

Grossm√ºnster - This church is one of the most recognizable landmarks of Zurich. For a small fee, you can pay to climb to the top of the tower for an amazing view.
Price -  4 CHF ($4.22)

Lake Zurich - The city of Zurich is surrounds Lake Zurich, which is unbelievably clean and pure.

Kronenhalle Restaurant  - This is one of the most legendary and classic restaurants in all of Zurich, Switzerland. I didn‚Äôt realized it was so expensive and so high end, but we decided to go for it anyway, because I was looking forward to trying their Z√ºrcher Geschnetzeltes, the most well known of all Zurich Swiss food dishes consisting of thin sliced potato paired with veal stew. It‚Äôs quite a stunning dish and the version at Kronenhalle Restaurant was absolutely stunning.
Total price - 126 CHF ($132.98)

Bahnhofstrasse Shopping street 

Rheinfelder Bierhalle - To finish off this ultimate Swiss food tour of Zurich in a single day we went to Rheinfelder Bierhalle, a beer hall and restaurant in Zurich. I ordered their specialty, Jumbo Jumbo Cordon Bleu. Cordon bleu is another one of the Swiss food dishes you don‚Äôt want  to miss when you‚Äôre in Zurich.

Thank you very much for watching this  Swiss food tour!

JHWlSrIgwwE,Lanzarote Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"The island oasis of Lanzarote, Spain, is eagerly awaiting your arrival. Venture to the easternmost island of the Spanish archipelago and discover this scenic hot spot. With the help of artist and architect Cesar Manrique, Lanzarote‚Äôs landscape has integrated the natural beauty of the island with organic building designs. 

Kick-start your travels at the Cesar Manrique Foundation, which was once the home of the famous architect. You‚Äôll come across rooms that are built into caves created by a volcano eruption long ago. To see more of Manrique‚Äôs artistic work, head to the Jardin de Cactus, which features more than 10,000 plants, and then relish the majestic views from the Mirador del Rio. Jameos del Agua is another fascinating attraction, where you can climb down the staircase into caves with restaurants and a concert venue. 

Want to see more of the island‚Äôs captivating scenery? Tour the fire mountains at Timanfaya National Park and marvel at the flames rising from the center of the earth, or simply bask on the pristine shores of Playa del Carmen. If you‚Äôd prefer to make a splash, head to the rock pools at Punta Mujeres and go on a snorkeling excursion around the cove. To top it all off, round out your adventures with a jaunt to the charming village of Yaiza, a 17th-century town, and soak up the touristy area at Puerto del Carmen. 

Come to this slice of paradise for the beaches and Manrique‚Äôs contributions. Whatever you decide to do during your stay, take a peek at our Lanzarote travel guide for the inside scoop on this inviting destination.

A believer that compositions should be both seen and heard, his music looks as strange as it sounds. Swirles, squiggles, arrows, and fangs often replace traditional notes and rests. His aesthetic preferences gravitate towards yowls and yips and wails and squeals. Towards screams that masquerade as art. Towards clamor and deviance. Ewen‚Äôs music swings from chandeliers.

About TEDx, x = independently organized event In the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. At a TEDx event, TEDTalks video and live speakers combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. These local, self-organized events are branded TEDx, where x = independently organized TED event. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events are self-organized.* (*Subject to certain rules and regulations)",art and music

Saving Private Ryan is a 1998 American epic war drama film set during the Invasion of Normandy in World War II. Directed by Steven Spielberg and written by Robert Rodat, the film is notable for its graphic portrayal of war, and for the intensity of its opening 27 minutes, which includes a depiction of the Omaha Beach assault of June 6, 1944. It follows United States Army Rangers Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and a squad (Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Adam Goldberg, and Jeremy Davies) as they search for a paratrooper, Private First Class James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), who is the last-surviving brother of four servicemen.

The film received universal critical acclaim, winning several awards for film, cast, and crew, as well as earning significant returns at the box office. The film grossed US$481.8 million worldwide, making it the second highest-grossing film of the year. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominated the film for 11 Academy Awards; Spielberg's direction won him a second Academy Award for Best Director, with four more awards going to the film. Saving Private Ryan was released on home video in May 1999, earning another $44 million from sales. In 2014, Saving Private Ryan was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry as it was deemed ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.""",history

25 Things to do in Budapest, Hungary travel guide video transcript:

Today we‚Äôre taking you around a city we‚Äôve been wanting to visit for a while: Budapest! With beautiful architecture and stunning vistas all around, it‚Äôs easy to see why it‚Äôs nicknamed the Pearl of the Danube, but Budapest is more than just than just good looks. This is a city with youthful vibes, vibrant street art, alternative nightlife, delicious food and so much more! In this travel guide we‚Äôre going to try and highlight just that along with the main attractions, so let‚Äôs dive right in, and let us show you a few things to do in Budapest on your next visit!

And that‚Äôs a wrap in Budapest! We hope you enjoyed this video guide and that it gave you a few ideas of things to do around the city. If you have any other suggestions of things to do in Budapest feel free to share those in the comments below.

This is part of our Travel in Hungary video series showcasing Hungarian food, Hungarian culture and Hungarian cuisine.

P0Rlw8mo8g,Is Music Art? ‚Äì Hangout on Air,"In our fifth and final 'Hangout on Air', Miranda Sawyer is joined by artist Haroon Mirza, music producer Will Skeaping, record sleeve designer Leif Podhajsky and Tate's Adrian Shaw for a lively discussion about music and art.

Miranda Sawyer is a journalist, writer and broadcaster covering a wide range of interests, including music, art, radio and theatre. She is currently a feature writer and radio critic for The Observer, and is a regular arts critic in print and on television and radio. Miranda is also on the board of Tate Members.

Haroon Mirza is a British artist who combines a variety of readymade and time based material to create audio compositions, which are often realised as site-specific installations. In doing so, Mirza complicates the distinctions between noise, sound and music, and alters the function and meaning of everyday objects and and socio-cultural constructs.

Adrian Shaw is part of Tate‚Äôs Learning department, working on the Young People‚Äôs Programme. He has been organising music events since the early 1990‚Äôs and introduced large scale music programming to Tate over 10 years ago.  Now established as ‚ÄòLate at Tate‚Äô, these events often explore the boundaries between music, performance and art.  Adrian is also a musician, and one half of the arts duo boyleANDshaw.

Will Skeaping is a creative consultant and music producer. Following a tour of duty at Google, he worked closely with rappers, authors and film makers as label manager at Lex Records, focusing on collaborations between artists and musicians. He is currently making an album uniting English folk music with vintage analogue synthesizers. 

Leif Podhajsky is an Australian artist and graphic designer, who‚Äôs distinctive bright, surreal abstractions have featured on posters and album covers for musicians including Mount Kimbie, Tame Impala, Grimes, Lykki Li and Foals. Leif says his work ‚Äúexplores themes of connectedness, the relevance of nature and the psychedelic or altered experience.‚Äù

When I was in Dubai, I had the privilege of hanging out and eating with my friend Peyman (). He‚Äôs from Dubai, he loves to eat, and he knows some of the best food spots in Dubai. So in this Dubai food tour, we went around and ate Emirati food, rice and lamb, street food, karak tea, and finally ended with home cooked Emirati food at Peyman‚Äôs home.

One thing I want to quickly mention, and Peyman and I discussed this in the video as well, is that Emirati food at restaurants is still not very common in Dubai. This is because there are so many international restaurants in Dubai, and local Emiratis typically just eat their food at home. But things are changing and there is starting to be a higher demand for Emirati food in Dubai.

Al Fanar Restaurant - One of the only full Emirati food restaurants in Dubai. We ordered Luqaimat, Tharid, Madrooba, Balaleet. All the food was fantastic, and it‚Äôs a nice environment.
Total price - 280 AED ($76.21)

Karak - 0.50 AED ($0.14) per cup - This is originally adapted from India, but it‚Äôs a full part of the culture in UAE, and you can get cups of karak tea right to your car.

Al Marhabani Restaurant - Mandi is one of the greatest Arabian food dishes, originally from Yemen. It includes rice and meat that‚Äôs traditionally cooked in an underground oven. The lamb here was outstanding.
Total price - 200 AED ($54.44)

Al Labeeb Grocery - Regag bread - This is a little gem of a shop that Peyman took me to. They make some Dubai street food style crepes with cheese and fish sauce, and it‚Äôs awesome.
Price - 6 AED ($1.63) each

Machboos - Finally at Peyman‚Äôs house for dinner, he cooked machboos, one of the national dishes of UAE. It was a great way to end this Dubai food tour!

Thank you for watching this Dubai food tour!

Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be.

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

Don‚Äôt forget to subscribe to Best Ever Food Review Show, so we can connect through food and travel and become Bestys!

Support the channel by becoming a member:


When it comes to Western role-playing games, few video game developers are as renowned as Bioware. The Edmonton-based studio‚Äôs catalogue is as celebrated as it is influential, with almost all of its titles representing the peaks of their genres in the eras they debuted. Baldur‚Äôs Gate brought computer RPGs back in vogue with its sublime, high-fantasy gameplay. Neverwinter NightsKnights masterfully adapted its tenets into a multiplayer-centric experience. Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic saw the former games‚Äô narrative finesse melded with the adventurism of the galaxy far, far away. And Mass Effect made all of this Bioware‚Äôs own ‚Äì while taking it to the next level.

 But being this renowned comes with a high heavy price. Today, gamers are well aware of the struggles the studio dealt with recently during the development of games like Mass Effect: Andromeda and Anthem. Yet the reality is that struggles like these have persisted throughout its entire history, with nearly every major production that Bioware has successfully completed representing a triumph in the face of massive adversity. 

 Dragon Age, Bioware‚Äôs much-beloved high-fantasy series, is perhaps most emblematic of this. While each of its mainline entries were made under vastly different circumstances from one another, they all suffered in their own, unique ways. Its third one‚Äôs design failed to fully come together until late in its production, and needed to be made in an incredibly unruly engine. Its second one‚Äôs development period was one of the most cramped its staff had ever experienced. And its first operated without a consistent team or set of tools for an immensely long ‚Äì so much so, that many wondered if it was ever going to come out at all.
 This is the history of Dragon Age: Origins.

dbo_wbfRZm0,25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction,"It‚Äôs an undeniable fact that the newest technologies such as mobile tech, genetic engineering, and the emerging field of nanotech differ from the technologies that preceded them in a fundamental way. Our world is transforming rapidly and violently to the point where many people feel completely unable to comprehend and utilize these advancements. Ironically, we witnessed many of these new ‚Äúthings‚Äù and technologies in sci-fi films and graphic comics first, and if someone had told us back then that it would only take a couple of decades for these changes to enter our lives, we would have probably laughed.  Think about it: Back in the early ‚Äô90s emerging computer technology was used by a limited number of people worldwide, and now, a quarter century later, everyone has a smartphone and a laptop. Can you even imagine what the world will look like in 2030, even 2050? And the scariest part of all (especially if you‚Äôre a geek like me) is the fact that science fiction, the literature of the human species encountering vast, mind-altering changes, whether they arrive via scientific discoveries, technological innovations, natural events, aliens, or societal shifts, has recently lost its magic and glimpse to the point we wonder what is real and what is not nowadays. But if you think we‚Äôre being over-dramatic, then check out these 25 Modern Science And Technologies You'd Swear Are Science Fiction and you will see we‚Äôre not exaggerating at all.

iOS was introduced with the original iPhone over a decade ago, and has since become a ubiquitous part of our everyday lives. But there are some things about the operating system that you may not know, like the fact that Apple initially developed it for the iPad, not the iPhone. But since its release in 2007, iOS has not only become one of the most powerful mobile operating systems in the world, but it‚Äôs helped reshape the entire tech industry. iOS has transcended the iPhone to become an integral part of multiple apple products, with underpinnings of the operating system present in the Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. And its influence on software in other products like cars, appliances, kiosks, and even vending machines are undeniable. So in this video we‚Äôre going to explore the history of iOS and find out why it‚Äôs one of the most important operating systems ever made.

jvYTiPQAyAE,How art and music create a new hybrid global culture: Rajae El Mouhandiz at TEDxBreda,"The ""one story"" of Muslims and immigrants we hear in the news and politics every day is ignoring the many stories of millions of women and men who do not see themselves in that old story, but as authors and owners of a new story where globalism and hybrid cultures are the stage and vehicle. They represent a new story of being and belonging in the world. A story where history is honoured as the sacrifices of those who came before us. Their parents moved to the west to start something new, mixed with the old, and individuals like Rajae El Mouhandiz are the product. As the new stories they are shaping do not yet have a language and a platform, one has to start telling the stories through art and music. And personal strength.

Regarding Rajae El Mouhandiz
Rajae El Mouhandiz is a Dutch-Moroccan-Algerian poet, singer, composer, producer, and founder of the record label Truthseeker Records. After leaving her family at age 15 and being the first Moroccan to study at a Dutch conservatory at age 16. El Mouhandiz left classical music at age 20 to follow her own artistic path, seeking to incorporate her cultural roots. She started her own record label at age 25, released two albums and is currently developing her third album in Morocco. On international women's day 2013 El Mouhandiz premiered her first short documentary film, about the acceptance of Muslim women in mainstream media and the music industry. Currently she is developing her second short film, focusing on her Maghreb heritage and the story of her grandfathers. She is also one of the 60 female curators of the groundbreaking international MUSLIMA exhibition, held in The USA, The Philipines, The U.A.E and Denmark. And together with the British Council Ireland and a Dutch theatre production company, El Mouhandiz is producing the Dutch and European version of the Hijabi Monologues; a theatre space for the experiences of Muslim women; a space to breathe as they are; a space that does not claim to tell every story and speak for every voice. The Dutch premiere is planned in September 2014. Rajae was nominated as Muslim Leader of tomorrow in 2005. She was nominated by Elsevier magazine as one of Hollands' 10 biggest talents in 2007, in the field of contemporary music and from 2009 -- 2012 she was the only female contemporary artist to be nominated on the list of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world. This year Rajae has been nominated for the 5th year in a row. More information: www.rajae.net",art and music

Come fai a collaborare con le aziende?
Avendo un canale youtube dove tratto argomenti femminili dal makeup, ai capelli, ai vestiti, ai prodotti per il corpo solitamente vengo contattata dalle aziende che mi propongono i loro prodotti.

S-hFKC_RKI,Tokyo Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Tokyo.d179900...

Welcome to Tokyo, the capital of Japan and the epitome of the word ‚Äúmegacity.‚Äù

In this vast metropolis, ancient traditions blend with futuristic buildings, and your Tokyo sightseeing will take you to representations of each. Pay your respects at temples set in forested hillsides, then flex your credit card in one of the shopping districts, before sitting down to a five-star meal‚Ä¶all in one day.

Your Tokyo tour begins with the subway and train system, which will take you all over this sprawling city. Tokyo is home to some 35 million people, many of which you‚Äôll meet as its public transit carries you throughout its many neighborhoods. Make a stop in Asakusa, a temple district nestled in leafy trees with skyscrapers towering in the background. There you‚Äôll visit Nakamisi Dori, a street loaded with food vendors and religious charms. Get to know the city a little better in the Harajuku district, home to cutting-edge fashion, a thriving, youth-centered culture, and the famous Yoyogi Park. The park stands out in stern contrast to the rest of the neighborhood; this sprawling, 134-acre green space is where locals slow down after a frenzied week of work and play.

 As night falls, make your way to Shinjuku. Many of Tokyo‚Äôs premier restaurants and pubs span Shinjuku‚Äôs streets, and you can indulge in succulent 5-star meals or sample with fast food from local vendors. Watch a movie, do some karaoke, and linger with fellow travelers and friendly locals alike.

What was your favorite part of Tokyo?

Thanks to Guilherme () for taking us around Brazil.

SALVADOR, BAHIA - Before ever going to Brazil, Salvador was one of the top cities I wanted to visit - and finally this is the time. In this all out ultimate street food tour of Salvador we‚Äôll focus especially on Afro-Brazilian food and culture, the heart of Salvador, Bahia. The people were amazing, the food was delicious.     

Sao Joaquim Market - To begin this street food tour we started in the morning at Sao Joaquim Market, one of the main fruits and vegetables market, with restaurant and food as well. One thing you‚Äôll see all over the market, different from other parts of Brazil is dend√™ oil, the orange palm oil originally from West Africa.

Recanto Da Lucia - At the market we ate breakfast at Recanto Da Lucia, a small local Brazilian food stall serving amazing dishes like feijoada and pir√£o. Total price - 80 BRL ($20.61)

Dona Susana - Next up on this Afro-Brazilian food tour of Salvador, we drover to Dona Susana, a restaurant under the highway, with a million dollar view. The main dish to eat in Bahia is Moqueca Bahiana, a stew of fish or seafood in palm oil and coconut milk. Her‚Äôs was outstanding as was the ensopado de camar√£o and her version of pir√£o. One of the most stunning locations so far in Brazil. Total price - 87 BRL ($22.41)

Pelourinho - This is the center of the historic city of Salvador, with a distinct Portuguese style and influence. If you look around, you might think you‚Äôre in Portugal.

Capoeira - Pelourinho is a center of art and culture and I had a chance to learn about Capoeira, an Afro-Brazilian martial art, but a dance at the same time. It‚Äôs amazing to watch and they even volunteered me to stand as they came dangerously close to kicking me!

Elevador Lacerda - In Pelourinho you‚Äôll also find the Elevador Lacerda, which takes you from lover Salvador to the upper part of Salvador.
Price - .15 BRL ($0.03) per person

Mercado Modelo - One of the main central old city markets in Salvador, Bahia is Mercado Modelo, and while most of the market is pretty touristy, Jacibar on the outside serves up delicious local dishes. We ordered Xinxin de Galinha, Bob√≥ de camar√£o, and Caruru. It was an incredible meal. Total price - 180 BRL ($46.37)

Tambores e Cores - Samba beats represent Salvador, Bahia, and the thundering drums are a must see when you‚Äôre in Bahia, Brazil.

Boteco Di Janela - In the evening we went to Boteco Di Janela, a bar and restaurant, friendly owners, and delicious seafood. We ate sarapatel - a blood stew, and sururu - small local mussels.

Acaraj√© da Ivone - If there‚Äôs one Brazilian street food snack you have to eat in Salvadar, it‚Äôs Acaraj√©, a life-changing bun of blackeyed peas deep fried in palm oil and stuffed with vatapa, caruru, shrimp, and salad. It‚Äôs is unbelievable and the owners at Acaraj√© da Ivone were equally as friendly and hospitable. I also had an Abara, the same thing except the black eyed pea fritter is steamed instead of fried. Price - 8 BRL ($2.06) per

Salvador, Bahia, in Brazil, exceeded my expectations - the food and people were outstanding and made it a city and destination I will never forget. What a stunning combination of natural beauty, food, and hospitality.

This talk was originally meant to be given at the controversial Pakistan Tourism Summit 2019 in Islamabad, but was cut out by the organizers once they realized its critical nature. Let's see if the internet is more open minded than they were.

People with power, feel free to get in touch if you're ever ready to have a real talk.

zSHcyXfNP,Iceland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"With a population of only 300,000, Iceland can feel like the most isolated place on earth, yet its capital Reykjavik, is only a three-hour flight from London and just under six from New York.
 
Reykjavik is relaxed and welcoming, yet possesses a cultural life that holds its own against other European capitals. Most buildings are built simple and low to beat the North Atlantic winds. However, the city is also graced with grand civic architecture inspired by Iceland‚Äôs natural beauty, such as the soaring central tower of Hallgr√≠mskirkja.
 
Many of the country‚Äôs most popular sights are within easy reach of Reykjav√≠k. Immerse yourself in the spirit of Iceland, at the Blue Lagoon. Then spend a day or two in The Golden Circle, an area which encompasses three of Iceland‚Äôs greatest natural wonders; Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Field, and Gullfoss.
 
Iceland‚Äôs main ring road strings together an endless series of epic landscapes. Less than two hours drive east of Reykjavik are two of the world‚Äôs most beautiful waterfalls, Seljalandsfoss and Sk√≥gafoss. Continue eastward towards V√≠k, Iceland‚Äôs southern-most village, where you‚Äôll find the dramatic landscapes of Black Beach, Reynisdrangar, and Dyrholaey. Follow the ring road for another two hours into the ethereal light of J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n Lake, where icebergs break away from Europe‚Äôs largest glacier and float for years before tumbling out to sea.
 
Head north and feel the earth rumble at Europe‚Äôs mightiest waterfall, Dettifoss. Then explore the Myvatn region, a tranquil lake surrounded by nature in all its violent beauty. Take a careful walk through the boiling landscape of Namafjall, lose yourself amid the lava pillars of Dimmuborgir, and peer into the caldera of Krafla Volcano.
 
Known as the Capital of the North, Akureyri is the perfect place to warm up and enjoy some creature comforts, before heading off into the wilds again. In Iceland, every side road is a story waiting to unfold. So come, and live your own Icelandic story, it‚Äôs one you‚Äôll keep telling for the rest of your days.

XE3XJK8CG6I,5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical Discoveries,"5 Most Amazing Accidental Historical Discoveries

Rich soil always appreciates good care so it can provide miraculous natural gifts to the farmer. However, James Bristle, a farmer from Michigan, got something more exciting from the ground. He had a field to grow soybeans and one day he noticed something sticking out of the ground that looked like an old decayed fence post at first sight. However, the find turned out to be much more amazing. James got an excavator to dig deeper and was stunned to see a well-preserved skull. These were the bones of a wooly mammoth that lived on the planet about 15,000 years ago. The multiton giant was approximately 40 years old when it died. Archaeologists found most of the animal‚Äôs skeleton, including the almost intact skull with tusks, though they did not find its limbs. Apparently, some hunters separated and took the limbs and put the mammoth‚Äôs body in storage. It is noteworthy that James exercised his right to keep some of the mammoth remains and gave most of the bones and the skull to a local museum. That was the first discovery, let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs next!",history

ZnZEoOJ-cxE,Japan in the Heian Period and Cultural History: Crash Course World History 227,"In which John Green teaches you about what westerners call the middle ages and the lives of the aristocracy...in Japan. The Heian period in Japan lasted from 794CE to 1185CE, and it was an interesting time in Japan. Rather than being known for a thriving economy, or particularly interesting politics, the most important things to come out of the Heian period were largely cultural. There was a flourishing of art and literature in the period, and a lot of that culture was created by women. The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu was the classic piece of literature of the day, and it gave a detailed look into the way the Aristocrats of the Heian period lived. While this doesn't give a lot of insight into the lives of daily people, it can be very valuable, and the idea of approaching history from a cultural perspective is a refreshing change from the usual military or political history that survives from so many eras.

Songs From the Northern Territory 4: Aboriginal Music From North-Eastern Arnhem Land Including Groote Eylandt 
Artist/Collector: 
Alice Moyle 
Label Information: 
Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies (AIATSIS): AIAS 4 CD 
Media Type: 
CD 
Year: 
Recorded 1963; Released 1997 
Availability: 
AIATSIS 

Notes: For the purpose of music description, Eastern Arnhem Land of the Northern 
Territory is divided here as follows: the north-eastern sector including offshore 
islands; the eastern sector, extending along the coast as far south as the Roper 
River; and the Groote Eylandt archipelago north-west of the Gulf of Carpentaria. 
Field recordings reproduced on this compact disc were collected at Milingimbi and 
Yirrkala in the north-eastern sector and at Angurugu and Umbakumba on Groote Eylandt.
 
The Aboriginal communities at Milingimbi and Yirrkala, together with the people at 
Galiwin'ku (previously known as Elcho Island) have been referred to in the 
anthropological literature as the Murngin (WL Warner) and Wulamba (RM Berndt). More 
recently, they have become known as the Yolngu, from a local word meaning 'people'. 
The people on Groote Eylandt were known by mainland groups as the Wayingurra and 
their language, Ingurra. In the absence of a name for the Groote Eylandters, 
Warnindilyakwa, a name formerly given to one of the larger clans on the island, is 
sometimes used. Anindilyakwa is the name of the island language. 
Item characteristics of Eastern Arnhem Land clan songs performed and recorded in 
the 1960s-all of which were sung by men-are summarised here as follows: (1) a didjeridu 
accompaniment which utilises two tones differing widely in pitch (the interval between 
the higher or overblown tone and the fundamental often sounding close to a tenth 
but varying according to the shape and length of the hollowed branch); (2) a narrow 
vocal range of pitch (compare them, for instance, with Western Arnhem Land songs) 
which rarely exceeds a fifth or sixth and may be less than a second; (3) song words 
which are translatable, meaningful and appropriate to relevant clan territories 
and related myths; and (4) the occurrence of an unaccompanied vocal termination (UVT), 
or termination of a song item by voice or voices alone after the accompanying 
instruments have ceased. Good examples of this fourth item characteristic are to be 
heard on this disc (Track 1) and disc 3 (Track 11). 
Song refrains may consist of repeated strings of words and syllables, a prolonged 
single syllable or a repeated pattern of vocal sounds (for example, bird calls). 
These calls are incorporated into the particular sectional or phraselike structure 
of many item sequences performed in Eastern Arnhem Land. 
On Groote Eylandt (tracks 7-13), only the first three of the above characteristics 
are to be heard. There is no occurrence of the UVT in these items but the following 
additional characteristics distinguish emeba (Groote Eylandt clan songs) from manikay 
(north-eastern Arnhem Land clan songs): 
a. the shaky voice, a deliberate manner of vocal ornamentation used by some emeba singers; 
b. the break or brief cessation of the vocal part of a Groote Eylandt clan song which is 
signalled by certain words the singer chooses to sing (the song subject at this point may 
fall, swoop down, or change abruptly in some way-it was said that the break gives the singer 
time to decide which words to sing next); 
c. a short, patterned interplay between sticks and didjeridu during the break; and 
d. the general clatter of stick-beating percussion arising from several different sources 
at the same time. 
Further comparison of emeba and manikay reveals that, whereas the durations of the latter 
are usually about one minute or less, emeba items may last for more than two minutes each.

daVaEoF5Hrk,Arnold Sch√∂nberg - Wassily Kandinsky: Music and Art Get One,"The early years of the 20th Century signed a terrific advance in the Physical Sciences. The Special (1905) and General (1916)  Theories of Relativity and the advent of Quantum Mechanics (1926) changed our lives profoundly. Around the same years, a similar revolution took place in both Music and Art. The year 1909 marks a decisive break with tonality (the structure of classical music) by Arnold Sch√∂nberg in his ""Three Piano Pieces"". The term 'Atonality' is commonly used to express this new type of composition. Wassily Kandinsky is credited with painting the first 'purely abstract' works. His production is vast and I could only include 20 of his works here, selected from a period of time that overlaps with the musical pieces by Sch√∂nberg presented in this video. They knew each other and have possibly influenced their works reciprocally. The video is an attempt to evince this intriguing 'connection' between music and painting.


About Arnold Sch√∂nberg (1874-1951):
...The final piece (of the Three Piano Pieces, Op.11) breaks through all constraints of traditional language or structure, cutting abruptly from extremes of eruptive power, as in the massively congested opening, to the most intense introspection. Perhaps Schoenberg had in mind Kandinsky, with whom he had close  contacts, when he likened such music to developments in painting -""without architecture... an ever-changing, unbroken succession of colours, rhythms and moods."" (From a Text by Peter Hill).

About Wassily Kandinsky (1866-1944):
...As the ""Der Blaue Reiter""(*) Almanac essays and theorizing with composer Arnold Sch√∂nberg indicate, Kandinsky also expressed the communion between artist and viewer as being available to both the senses and the mind (Synesthesia). Hearing tones and chords as he painted, Kandinsky theorized that, for instance, yellow is the colour of middle C on a brassy trumpet; black is the colour of closure, and the end of things; and that combinations of colours produce vibrational frequencies, akin to chords played on a piano. Kandinsky also developed a theory of geometric figures and their relationships, claiming, for example, that the circle is the most peaceful shape and represents the human soul.  (From Wikipedia).

Note Added: (*) Der Blaue Reiter (The Blue Rider) was a group of artists from the Neue √ºnstlervereinigung M√ºnchen in Munich, Germany. The group was founded by a number of Russian emigrants, including Wassily Kandinsky, Alexej von Jawlensky, Marianne von Werefkin, and native German artists, such as Franz Marc, August Macke and Gabriele M√ºnter. Der Blaue Reiter was a movement lasting from 1911 to 1914, fundamental to Expressionism, along with Die Br√ºcke which was founded in 1905.

FRQnL2IWCXk,Fifty Years of Chinese Science and Technology,"Prof. Geoff Oldham reflects on his experiences over fifty years, starting with this first visit to the Chinese mainland in October 1964 when he wrote in Science magazine of ‚Äúthe beginning of the Chinese scientific revolution‚Äù. He recalls decades of collaborative work between SPRU and Chinese institutions through the 1970s and 80s, including research conducted on technology transfer in the oil industry and in the area of ‚Äòclean coal technologies‚Äô, links between provincial level research and policy making, and his contributions to policy evaluations in the 1980s and 1990s that saw him working alongside Chinese and international colleagues and reporting directly to the Minister of Science and Technology. Tracing China‚Äôs changing science and technology policies from the early focus on self-reliance to the ‚Äòcatching up‚Äô of the reform and opening period that paved the way for China‚Äôs emerging leadership and current patterns of international collaboration, his talk charts the country‚Äôs ongoing transformation and the changing role of science and technology within it. It alsos provide an account reflecting on personal memories that have shaped Professor Oldham‚Äôs perspectives on this process.

HNfSBCygXTg,History of Russia Part 2,"Epic History TV's history of Russia continues! Emerging from the Time of Troubles, Russia fights back against foreign invaders, as Prince Pozharksy and Kuzma Minin liberate Moscow from Polish forces. Russia's assembly, the Zemsky Sobor, turns to a 16 year old boy, Mikhail Romanov, for leadership. He and the early Romanovs oversee a turbulent period of war, reform and rebellion: all Russian peasants are made serfs by the terms of the Sobornoye Ulozheniye, while Patriarch Nikon's religious reforms split the Russian Orthodox Church between Reformers and Old Believers. The Thirteen Years War (1654 ‚Äì 67) against the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth brings Smolensk and Kiev under Russian control, as Cossack renegade (and folklore hero) Stenka Razin leads revolt in the south. 

In 1689, Peter the Great seizes power from his half-sister, Princess Regent Sofia. Peter is determined to make Russia a great European power, and travels to the Dutch Republic and England to study the latest developments in science and shipbuilding. He wages successful wars against the Ottoman Empire, acquiring the Black Sea port of Azov, and defeats Sweden in the Great Northern War, winning one of Russia's most famous victories at Poltava in 1709. He builds a new capital, St.Petersburg, as well as a Russian navy, and reforms education, industry and government. Not without internal opposition, Peter's boundless energy transforms Russia. 

The second half of Russia's 18th century is dominated by female rulers. Under the reign of Empress Anna Ioannovna, Vitus Bering charts the coast of Alaska and discovers the Aleutian Islands. Empress Elizabeth leads Russia into the Seven Years War against Frederick the Great, with Russian victory at Kunersdorf in 1759, and oversees construction of St.Petersburg's stunningly lavish and expensive Winter Palace. While Peter III falls victim to a conspiracy by his wife Catherine and army officers, leading to his own death, and the reign of Catherine the Great..

EMd6tQQIp8,"Thai Street Food in Bangkok - MOST POPULAR LUNCH Noodles in Downtown Silom, Thailand!","Thai street food lunch tour in Silom, Bangkok!

I met up with my friend Drew Binsky (check out his YouTube channel:  and Facebook: ) to go on a lunch-rush street food tour of Silom.

Silom is one of the main financial business districts of Bangkok, it‚Äôs a downtown of Bangkok. Everyday at lunch floods of people from their offices come down for lunch and enjoy delicious street food. What I love so much about Silom is because it has such a vibrant and busy lunchtime rush, and that‚Äôs part of the fun.

We arrived a little early, to get a couple lunches in before the main lunch. The highlight of this Thai street food tour for me was Kuay Teow Khae (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÅ‡∏Ñ‡∏∞ (‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏ï‡∏£ ‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏ï‡∏£) ‡∏Ñ‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏ï‡πå), one of the most popular lunch noodles shops in Bangkok!

Ok, here‚Äôs all the food we ate in this tour:

Khao Man Gai Ban Deed Kim (‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏°‡∏±‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà‡∏ö‡∏±‡∏ç‡∏ë‡∏¥‡∏ï‡∏Ñ‡∏¥‡∏°) - If you‚Äôve ever gotten off the BTS at Sala Daeng station and walked down Soi Convent, you‚Äôve probably walked right by this stall. And I‚Äôve walked past it hundreds of times, but this was actually my first time to stop and eat there. They are well known in Bangkok for their khao man gai (‡∏Ç‡πâ‡∏≤‡∏ß‡∏°‡∏±‡∏ô‡πÑ‡∏Å‡πà), Thai style Hainanese chicken and rice. We each ordered a plate to get things started. Overall, very good, light fluffy rice with just the right amount if chicken oil, bouncy chicken, and fermented soybean sauce.
Price - 50 THB ($1.52)

Yee Jay (‡∏¢‡∏µ‡πÄ‡∏à ‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÄ‡∏ô‡∏∑‡πâ‡∏≠‡∏ï‡∏∏‡πã‡∏ô-‡∏´‡∏°‡∏π‡∏ï‡∏∏‡πã‡∏ô) - Next we took a little walk through Silom, Downtown Bangkok, to another popular beef noodle shop. Again, it was my first time to eat here. We arrived before the main lunch rush, but at 11 am they were already preparing for the crowds with big amounts of meat waiting to be served. We had bowls of everything (‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏≤‡πÄ‡∏´‡∏•‡∏≤‡∏ó‡∏∏‡∏Å‡∏≠‡∏¢‡πà‡∏≤‡∏á), including organs and braised beef. Their soup was fragrant with Chinese spices and the aroma of beef. It‚Äôs not the best bowl of braised beef soup in Bangkok, but it‚Äôs decent.
Price - 70 THB ($2.14)

Kuay Teow Khae (‡∏Å‡πã‡∏ß‡∏¢‡πÄ‡∏ï‡∏µ‡πã‡∏¢‡∏ß‡πÅ‡∏Ñ‡∏∞ (‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏ï‡∏£ ‡πÇ‡∏Ñ‡∏ï‡∏£) ‡∏Ñ‡∏≠‡∏ô‡πÅ‡∏ß‡∏ô‡∏ï‡πå) - Finally for the main lunch, we went to one of the most popular Thai street food noodle stalls in Silom. For lunch everyday they are packed, every single seat, and if you arrive at a time like when we did, you have to wait to get a seat - sometimes 30 minutes or more. They have a few different options, but we all ordered their signature special bowl (‡πÄ‡∏™‡πâ‡∏ô‡πÇ‡∏ã‡∏ö‡∏∞‡∏¢‡∏≥‡πÅ‡∏´‡πâ‡∏á), including egg noodles topped with everything. This is one of the better single bowls of noodles in Bangkok in my opinion.
Price - 60 THB ($1.83)

Khanom Tokyo (‡∏Ç‡∏ô‡∏°‡πÇ‡∏ï‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ß (‡∏•‡∏∏‡∏á‡πÇ‡∏ï‡πÄ‡∏Å‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏ß) - Lastly, to end this Thai street food tour in Bangkok, we were just walking past with Uncle Tokyo called us over to try his snacks. He makes both savory (with a hot dog) and sweet versions, filled with a variety of different custards. Drew and I had to try the hot dog, mostly just for fun‚Ä¶ I‚Äôll be honest, not a big fan of Thai hot dogs, but the sweet ones were great. And Uncle Tokyo is such a nice friendly man. If you are on Soi Convent in Silom around lunchtime, go say hi to him!
Price - 4 for 10 THB ($0.30)

And that completes this Thai street food tour in Silom, hope you enjoyed it!

____________

With no written records from the Zulus themselves, historians and anthropologists have pieced together their history from a smattering of sources. We first learn of the Zulu as a minor tribe of the Bantu people, living in South Africa. Shaka Zulu, the man who would organize them into an empire, was born the illegitimate son of a Zulu king. He was sent away with his mother Nandi to grow up in her tribe, the Langeni, but he eventually caught the attention of Dingiswayo, the leader of another powerful tribe called the Mtethwa. Appointed as the leader of a squadron called an ibutho, Shaka developed new tactics including a short ""iklwa"" fighting spear and a simple but effective military maneuever called ""the Bull Horn."" When his father died, Shaka - now a successful military leader - returned with Dingiswayo's backing to assassinate the rightful heir and assume control of his native tribe. Just a year later, though, the neighboring Ndwandwe tribe murdered Dingiswayo and Shaka vowed revenge on their leader, Zwide. He then launched a bloody war that, combined with the strains created by European colonization, led to the Mefacane, or the Crushing.

Transcript:

You're joining me in a very special city. Let‚Äôs start with my preconceptions: I expected Japan‚Äôs capital, and home to the world‚Äôs largest urban population to be over the top and really in your face, with neon lights and anime at every turn and i certainly wasn‚Äôt disappointed. The streets are lined with towering, multi-storey buildings, each filled with mind bending department stores and arcades, offices to some of the world‚Äôs biggest brands and restaurants serving the best food you‚Äôll ever taste.

But despite all the apparent madness and chaos, spend a few days in Tokyo and it just makes sense. Here, efficiency is an art form. Japanese attention to detail is legendary, and it runs through everything, from food to public transport and urban planning. And yes, even the toilets. 

This trip was an educational and weirdly enlightening experience. I‚Äôve been lucky to visit a lot of amazing places making these videos, but Tokyo is in a league of its own.

So Tokyo, it‚Äôs big, it‚Äôs busy and it‚Äôs brilliant. As ever, let‚Äôs start with the airports.

Flying from the UK you‚Äôll come into one of Tokyo‚Äôs two major international airports, Haneda or Narita. Of course, you don‚Äôt need me to tell you that Tokyo is a really long way away, direct flights from Europe will take a whopping 12 hours for the nine and a half thousand kilometre journey.

So you‚Äôve got Haneda airport which is roughly 13 miles south of the city, and then you‚Äôve got 50 miles east. Fortunately, both are really easy to get to noisy noisy Tokyo. Here‚Äôs what you need to know.

From Haneda you have three main options, the airport limousine bus, a taxi or the monorail. The airport limousine takes between 30 and 45 minutes, stopping at most major hotels in the centre of town, with prices increasing for the night service between midnight and 5am.

A taxi should take about half and hour depending on traffic, with prices depending where you‚Äôre being dropped off. There‚Äôs also a 20% extra charge between 10pm and 5am.

However the quickest option is the airport‚Äôs dedicated monorail. It‚Äôll get you into Hamamatsucho station in 13 minutes and from here you can connect to the circular Yamanote metro line to reach other parts of the city. 

The metro runs between 9 and 7 on weekdays and then 9 to 5 on weekends and public holidays. That‚Äôs Haneda! Here‚Äôs what you need to know about Narita.

Narita is a whopping 50 miles east of Tokyo, so all of your transport options are going to take a while. The Airport Limousine bus and taxis runs from Narita but both will take anywhere between 90 minutes to 2 hours to reach central Tokyo. Instead, take the JR Narita Express. It‚Äôll whisk into town in a little under an hour, and with this being Japan, the trains are on time and super efficient.

A word of warning about getting home; if you‚Äôre flight‚Äôs on a Sunday, make sure you check the train times because there‚Äôs a reduced service. Check your departure time, and then allow plenty of extra time to get to the airport.",travel blogs

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James)  bringing you in DEEP for a FULL ON street food tour of Peshawar, Pakistan. Peshawar is one of the oldest market towns in the world and has one of the richest street food scenes you'll ever witness! You need to travel to Pakistan!

We're going Foodrangin' for tons of FAMOUS Pakistan Street Food - including the AMAZING BBQ Nisar Charsi Tikka Kababs, some amazing UNSEEN Pakistani Pulao, and ULTRA RARE PIZZA NAAN!!

You will fall in  love with the street food in Peshawar as soon as you arrive! Today, we're starting out with an UNSEEN Pulao, found in downtown Peshawar in the old area where there is street food everywhere! Here, it was full of basmati rice and huge chunks of beef and huge beef bones with unbelievably delicious bone marrow!

After this, we're going Foodrangin' and finding some local street stalls before going to Nisar Charsi Tikka BBQ Mutton HEAVEN!

First, we found a local Pakistan street food served right on the street, the fruit chaat! It was a delicious fruit salad topped with a rose syrup! This was amazing, but what was even more delicious than this famous food in Pakistan is the Pizza naan we found next!

After tasting  the fruit chaat, we walked down a local alley in Peshawar that was full of delicious Pakistani street food, like mutton kerahi (sometimes called Karhai) and fried street fish!

We found one of the most unique street foods in Pakistan, the Pizza naan! It was loaded with tomato, coriander, potato mash, and sliced potato! It was quite salty and was delicious!

After this, we made our way to Namak Mandi in Peshawar to visit the super famous and ultra unique Nisar Charsi Tikka! But first, we found a home cooked Pakistani street food, the Saag! Here, it was served with lassi and also Pakistani corn bread! It was so unique!

And for our final meal, we went to the WORLD FAMOUS Nisar Charsi Tikka! Here, we met the LEGEND himself, Mr. Nisar Charsi! Here, you can get huge BBQ kababs and also delicious Mutton Kerahi! It was  so amazing to taste!!!

I hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series! Thanks so much for watching, I would love to hear from you down below!

‚ñ∫Thanks Shehroze: 
‚ñ∫subscribe to my channel: 

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James) and my friends Shehroze and Alizeh are bringing you in FULL ON for a huge IFTAR Pakistani Street food in Karachi tour for RAMZAN also known as Ramadan!!  We're trying EXTREME Chicken Chargha cooked right on the street using local Pakistani recipes and spices and we are also going exploring down burns road in Karachi for lots more delicious street food!

‚ñ∫Huge thanks to Alizeh too: 

In this IFTAR Street Food tour of Karachi, Pakistan,We're going street food rangin' for tons of famous Pakistani Street Food in Karachi, mostly all the BEST and most famous Iftar Street food in Karachi, like samosas, gulab jamon, jalebi, extreme street chicken, and also some insanely delicious Pulao!! At first, I thought it was biryani, but it's actually Pulao!! It was full of chickpeas!

Karachi street food is VERY delicious and famous for food lovers! In this street food video, I'm starting out by exploring burns road and finding a famous Chicken chargha, WHOLE chicken coated in masala and spice and deep fried in the richest, darkest oil. I bought a whole chicken and packed it up in a bag and kept exploring the deep back alleys near burns road for more famous Pakistani street food.

After this, I found an alleyway selling thousands and thousands of unique street foods, right off of Burns road in Karachi. I stopped at the first and most busiest stall I saw, selling famous Pakistani pakoras, samosas, jalebi desserts, and more. I ordered a few of the best street foods I saw and tried to pay but no one would accept my payment! 

Then, we're meeting up with my friends Shehroze and Alizeh to break the fast for the Iftar for Ramzan (Ramadan). We found a local restaurant and brought all the food in and purchased some extra street food and started eating!

The next day, Shehroze and Alizeh are bringing us to a very local style place to break the fast with all the locals, right under a bridge! There were HUGE pots of biryani and pulao and everyone was waiting patiently for the food. We helped serve the biryani and pulao and then had a taste for ourselves! It was one of the BEST pulao rice I've ever tasted!

I hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series! Thanks so much for watching, I would love to hear from you down below!

There is much more street food in our Pakistani food videos series, get ready for the playlist of a lifetime!!

Hey, I‚Äôm Sonny! I‚Äôm from the US but currently call Vietnam home. I‚Äôve been living in Asia for 10 years and started making food and travel videos to document my experiences. People either enjoyed my undeniable charm or enjoyed watching me eat things like coconut worms, and thus Best Ever Food Review Show came to be.

I travel to different parts of the world, hunting down and documenting the most unique food each country has to offer. If you see any factual food errors in my videos, please feel free to politely let me know in the comments. I'm a huge fan of trying different, interesting foods in each country. My show is from a Western point of view, but more importantly, MY point of view. It is not meant to offend any person or culture.

BAhHZ1Gi9Kk,10 Oldest Technologies Scientists Still Can‚Äôt Explain,"Thousands of years ago great minds managed to create incredible technologies that were way ahead of their time, like a fire that couldn‚Äôt be extinguished by water, an unbreakable medieval sword, and even an ancient computer from 200 B.C.E.! You‚Äôd be surprised to find out what crazy inventions existed back then that science still can‚Äôt explain today.  If you‚Äôre ready to learn more about these mind-blowing ancient inventions plus a whole lot more, then keep on watching.

The Phaistos Disk in Crete 
Greek fire 
Damascus steel

The Voynich manuscript 
The Zhang Heng seismograph 
The Antikythera mechanism 

  

Music: 


SUMMARY
-Granodiorite rocks can easily be carved using temperature techniques. Hundreds of stone spheres were found quarried in the foothills of the Talamanca Mountains. Researchers even saw a gigantic ball weighing over 16 tons.
-The Roman dodecahedron had 12 flat pentagon-shaped faces with a knob protruding on each corner. It might have been a dice, a kid‚Äôs toy, a candle holder, a simple decoration, a measuring device on the battlefield, or an astronomical instrument, to name a few.
-The Phaistos Disk was made from clay and measures about 6.2 inches in diameter. Experts concluded that it was a prayer to an ancient Minoan goddess.
-The formula of Greek fire was a well-guarded state secret for over 7 centuries. Greek fire was used in naval warfare.
-Blades made from Damascus steel were the most sought after in medieval Europe. And that‚Äôs because they were the best swords at the time.
-The Iron pillar of Delhi dates back to the Gupta period, which lasted from about 240 to 590 C.E. A small amount of rust has started to form, but it is strange that there isn‚Äôt more.
-Viking Ulfberht swords are believed to have been made around 800 to 1,000 C.E., but experts were sure that the technology used to make swords of such extraordinary quality didn‚Äôt come around until 800 years later.
-The Voynich manuscript has 240 pages broken up into four sections: herbal, astrological, balneological, and pharmacological. There have literally been dozens of failed attempts to crack this thing.
-In 132 C.E., Zhang Heng, a Chinese inventor, astronomer, engineer, scientist, scholar, and artist, invented a seismoscope and presented it to the Han court as an instrument for measuring seasonal winds and the Earth‚Äôs movements.
-The Antikythera mechanism was retrieved by a group of divers in 1900 and has been dubbed ‚Äúthe world‚Äôs first analog computer‚Äù and it was made around 200 B.C.E.

5s0J-7W4i6,Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing,"The patented Ultrasonic Additive Manufacturing (UAM) process uses the power of sound to merge layers of metal foil. The process produces true metallurgical bonds with full density and works with a variety of metals such as aluminum, copper, stainless steel, and titanium. In combining additive and subtractive process capabilities, UAM can create deep slots, hollow, latticed, or honeycombed internal structures, and other complex geometries impossible with conventional subtractive manufacturing processes.  Additionally, the solid state nature of the UAM bond allows for welding of dissimilar metals.  This enables dissimilar metal cladding, production of custom metal matrix composites, and the ability to embed objects or sensors in a metal substrate.   Through the use of UAM technology, customers will be able to manufacture complex parts that have unique features and attributes not possible using traditional manufacturing techniques. In addition, parts currently made with traditional operations can be made with much less waste, an increasingly important factor as more expensive, higher performance materials see broader use.",manufacturing

How do bloggers make money?

I love, absolutely love reading about success stores of people starting a website, putting in the hard work for years and building wealth for themselves while producing a lot of value for everyone else.

This video is based of this Reddit post: 
The website in question is: 

Practical Wanderlust is a site that knows what it is. Practical travel advice, a little bit of story telling and a whole lot of work to make travel content that is insanely helpful. In the post she breaks down how she make money from blogging.

As someone who loves to travel, I sincerely appreciate the design and work ethic she has put into her blog. Anyways, enjoy the video :)

How do bloggers make money from blogging?

Her main sources of income are advertising at over 3k a month as well as professional writing gigs at 3k a month. This is followed up by affiliate marketing for another 3k. Of this affiliate marketing, about half is from Amazon and the other half are various other programs.

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James)  bringing you into Peshawar, Pakistan, for a FULL ON street food tour of Peshawar,  part 2! Peshawar is a famous old market town Pakistan with some of the biggest street food markets in the country. Peshawar's markets are full of delicious street food and tons of famous Pakistani cuisine. In one block, you can find SUPERHUMAN curry, Chapli Kababs AKA Chapli Kebabs,, chicken sajji, paya, and much more. Flying in to eat the street food in Pakistan is a great travel decision, and coming to Peshawar at the core is the best place in Pakistan to experience the street food scene! Peshawar has one of the richest street food scenes in the world! 

In today's street food video we're going Foodrangin' for tons of FAMOUS Pakistan Street Food - including the AMAZING famous Peshawar Chapli Kababs (Kebabs), HUGE Pulao Mountains, and UNSEEN street foods like Pakistani street food scrambled eggs and superhuman curry! There's so much street food in this video, you have to watch the whole Pakistani street food vlog! We're also bringing you to some ULTRA RARE Peshawar fried fish! There's so much Pakistani street food!! 

To start out our huge Peshawar street food tour, we're bringing you to a SUPER FAST street curry vendor, the CHENNA MASTER of Peshawar! He was ULTRA speedy the way he scooped up the chenna, and here, it was UPGRADED with a big scoop of mint chutney! One of the best street foods in the world! It was full of masala and very delicious! 

After this, we're bringing you foodrangin' even more and bringing you to a couple FAMOUS street foods in Peshawar. 

The first is a local Pakistani street food that is famous all throughout the country, but best here in Peshawar, the chapli kababs (kebabs). The kebab patties were full of local spices and masala and also hundreds of fried eggs! They were really heavy but so SATISFYING!! They were definitely one of the best street foods to try in Pakistan!

After this, we're bringing you to a famous Pulao to try in Pakistan, the Kabuli Pulao, but here, at the Shinwari Kabuli Pulao in Peshawar, it is even better! The GIANT pot is loaded up with tons of basmati and beef stock, and then after it's cooked using their secret masala and local Pakistani recipe, is loaded up with the most tender and fatty beef and huge scoops of carrot and raisin! It's sweet and also very fragrant and fatty and succulent! One of the best Pulao dishes in the world! 

After tasting the Kabuli Pulao, we walked down a busy market street of Peshawar and found a famous fried fish shop! Here, huge filets of fish are fried in a dark oil and covered in a spicy masala and served with lemon. It was super soft and juicy fish meat! 

After this, we found one of the most unique street foods in Pakistan, the 5 egg scramble with LIVER!  It was loaded with tomato and green chili and huge chunks of liver! It was quite spicy and very oily but also very satisfying!

After this, to finish off the day, we went right across the street from the 5 egg Pakistani style to try a local curry shop. Here, it was SUPERHUMAN curry because the flavours were some of the BEST in the world, SUPER DELICIOUS! There were over 20 curries to choose from and it was a delight to be able to choose the ones you like!

I hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series! Thanks so much for watching, I would love to hear from you down below!

5LYl4DM5c4,Street Food in Malaysia - ULTIMATE MALAYSIAN FOOD in Kuala Lumpur!,"Thanks to Oh My Media: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgmy...
Subscribe http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe for 2 new videos every week
T-shirts and caps: https://goo.gl/6WdK1l

Huge thank you to Fadhlur for reaching out and taking us on a Malaysian street food tour of Kuala Lumpur. It was an amazing day, and I have so much love to Malaysia as it was one of the first countries where I started making street food videos - as you‚Äôll see in the video!

Ok, here are all the street food stalls and restaurants we ate at on this tour:

Mansion Tea Stall
The thing to order here is the roti canai special, roti that chopped up, then doused in a variety of curry sauces, sambal, and a few soft boiled eggs. It‚Äôs a perfect way to begin your day in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 2.80 RM ($0.68) per plate

Nasi Lemak Tanglin
Nasi lemak is often considered the national food of Malaysia, and there are plenty of places to eat it throughout Kuala Lumpur. Having been around since 1948, Nasi Lemak Tanglin is a place I had wanted to go for a while. It was overall very good, with a nice laid back atmosphere and surrounded by nature. Nasi lemak - about 8 RM ($1.94) per plate

Ikan Bakar Seri Melaka (Jalan Bellamy)
One of my favorite places to eat ikan bakar, grilled fish, is on Jalan Bellamy. Back in 2012, I had to hike over a highway and climb a few fences to get there as I was only on foot. In this video, I‚Äôm a bit older, and we had a car! The ikan bakar was just as good as I remember it. Total price - 68 RM ($16.51) for everything

Sri Ganapathi Mess
One of the best things about Malaysian food is its incredible diversity, including Malay, Chinese, and Indian food. Banana leaf south Indian food is very popular and I was recommended to try Sri Ganapathi Mess, a restaurant tucked away into a home. An amazing south Indian food experience in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 59 RM ($14.32) for 4 people

Kedai Kopi Lai Foong
Finally, another dish that many had recommended me was the unique clam noodles in Kuala Lumpur Chinatown at the legendary Kedai Kopi Lai Foong. It was delicious, and a perfect way to end an amazing Malaysian street food tour in Kuala Lumpur. Price - 10 RM ($2.43) per bowl

Again, thank you to Oh My Media Malaysia for taking us around:

61l-xOwFQPg,BIGGEST Arabian Mandi Thali in Hyderabad | Kitchen visit & Tasting,"‚ñ∫ More Street Food in Hyderabad:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kt3mt...

‚ñ∫ Subscribe to Delhi Food Walks: https://www.youtube.com/user/Delhifoo...

Hyderabad is famous for its legendary Biryani and the eclectic mix of non vegetarian offerings that includes some of the best meat dishes from the erstwhile royal kitchens. But in recent times, a fantastic Arabic variation of this majestic dish that has been hogging the attention of the rice and meat lovers in and around the city, is the Yemeni delicacy Mandi. 

The unique thing about this dish is that here the flavoursome meat stock is used for cooking the rice. The separately cooked meat is served on the the top of the rice. The dish was introduced to the masses here, by the Arab people residing in the Barakas neighbourhood of the old city and since then it has become quite a sensation in the food circle all over Hyderabad. So in this episode let‚Äôs explore the Mandi and find out how it  looks and tastes and is prepared.

Mandi is traditionally served in a community style where a group of people share the dish from a single huge Thali. Hence the blissful experience is heightened not just by the yummy spread but also by the pleasant connection that happens over it.
Sankalp Bhai took us to the Yum Yum Tree restaurant to taste the most scrumptious Mandi. The ambience was similar to the  traditional Arabian setting where meal is served on low tools and people sit around it, on the floor to relish the food. We meet chef Ahmed who explained to us how Mandi is prepared and served. The cooking style is very different from other rice and meat dishes. 

After this informative conversation we sat down to try this fantastic Yemeni dish. The huge thali had a neat bed of the aromatic and flavourful Mandi rice. It was  topped with curried mutton pieces, a roasted chicken leg and a deep fried fish fillet. The garnish of fried onions and nuts ,sliced cucumber and fresh coriander made it more appetising. The thali also had three tasty accompaniments-chicken curry, salan and a thin spicy tomato chutnety. It was flavourful, delicious, rich and light on the palate, fragrant and satisfying. The enormous portion can easily feed three to four people. 

Then came the dessert platter where there was this traditional middle eastern semolina cake Basbousa and the super innovative oreo paan. We finished the feast with a cup of hot and ambrosial Sulemani chai. Getting introduced to this impressive Arabian delicacy was a fine experience. If you are a meat lover and happens to be in town then do try this unique dish and experience its amazing taste. We thank chef Ahmed and Sankalp bhai, a food aficionado and our host, for their cooperation and insights.

EPAYvmbENoM,Rethinking society for the 21st century: Developing a science and technology studies perspective,"Panel discussion with Professor Judith Sutz, Universidad de la Republica;  Professor Sheila Jasanoff, Harvard Kennedy School; and Professors Johan Schot and Andy Stirling, SPRU; as part of SPRU's 50th Anniversary Conference (September 2016). 
A large group of science, technology and innovation studies scholars is making a significant contribution to the report Rethinking Society for the 21st Century, produced by the International Panel on Social Progress. The Panel seeks to answer the question: Can we hope for a better society in the very challenging context of a series of system crises, growing inequality and climate change? To answer this question the IPSP has mobilised hundreds of social scientists (including economists) to provide answers and to deliver a report. It will have 22 chapters and address major issues, including: Social Justice, Inequality, Cities, Jobs, Markets, Finance, Corporations, Democracy, Sexuality, Violence, Wars, Peace and Security, and Multiple Directions of Social Progress. In the final chapter the report will discuss the contribution of social sciences to policy and institutional change. The Panel claims that it has no partisan political agenda, but aims at restoring hope in social progress and stimulating intellectual and public debates.",science and technology

I1QBHhbS0,Salzburg Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Salzburg.d180...

The Austrian city of Salzburg is situated on the northern edge of the Alps, close to the border of Germany. Surrounded by lakes and mountains, and straddling the banks of the Salzach River, few cities can match Salzburg‚Äôs fairytale setting.
 
Few places can match its musical heritage either. Salzburg is the hometown of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and provided the settings for one of cinema‚Äôs most-adored musicals, The Sound Of Music. 
  
Take the funicular to Hohensalzburg, one of Europe‚Äôs best-preserved medieval fortresses. Down below in the Old Town you‚Äôll find Salzburg Cathedral and the Salzburg Museum. Nearby, wander along narrow Getreidegasse, one of the loveliest shopping streets in the world. 
 
Just off the Old Market Square, savor 300 years of coffee-making tradition at Caf√© Tomaselli. For classical Austrian fare served with a side of Opera, take the short walk to Stiftskeller St. Peter. At the M√ºllner Br√§u Brewery, hang out with beer devotees from all over the world. 
 
Salzburg has long been a city where inspiration knows no bounds, especially when it comes to its palaces. Just a short stroll from the Marionette Theater, the grandeur of Mirabell Palace and Gardens awaits. While on Salzburg‚Äôs southern outskirts, explore the playful water features at Hellbrunn Palace.
 
While Salzburg abounds with fountains, some of the city‚Äôs most impressive water features are its natural ones, such as Lake Wolfgang and Krimml Waterfall. For a waterfall with a difference, visit the spa town of Bad Gastein, whose falls roar straight through the heart of town. From the town, take the cable car to the summit of Stubnerkogel Mountain and walk Europe‚Äôs highest suspension bridge.
 
The Salzburg region is full of surprises, so before heading back to the city, head underground, into the Hallein Salt Mine. From its salt mines to its symphonies, from its fountains to its waterfalls, Salzburg plays out like a living opera, filled with drama, comedy, intrigue and passion.",travel blogs

MRI8ffYKA8,Vienna Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Vienna.d17831...

On your next trip to Austria, pay a visit to its capital city of Vienna. During the late 19th and early 20th century, this city became a cultural epicenter of Europe, contributing art, philosophy, and culture on its way to becoming one of the world‚Äôs great cities.

During your Vienna sightseeing, you can drink coffee in the same cafes as Einstein and Freud, or wander down the streets that inspired Beethoven. Tour galleries devoted to some of the most magnificent artwork in all of Europe, then walk along the Ringstrasse. Also called ‚ÄúRing Road,‚Äù this downtown boulevard home to private residences, palaces, and other exquisite examples of architecture for you to marvel at. 

Much of Vienna tourism is centered in its cafes. This is not just because its residents love strong coffee‚Äîthough they do‚Äîbut because Viennese social life largely grows out of its coffee houses. Locals will spend hours at their favorite cafes, reading the paper, speaking to friends, working on projects, or listening to music in the evenings. Sit at a table and watch the people of Vienna stroll by, or enjoy a sachertorte, or chocolate cake, while catching up on your latest novel. It‚Äôs impossible to visit this city and not be inspired.

Vienna has long been called The City of Music. Find out why at the Vienna State Opera; a backstage tour will show you all the ins and outs of this majestic place, as well as give you a glimpse of why it has been at the forefront of entertainment since its construction in the 1800s. Afterward, head a few blocks south to the Volksgarten, or people‚Äôs garden. Stroll through its pathways and sniff the sweet fragrance of its hundreds of roses. What better way to end a day in one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful cities? 

What was your favorite part of Vienna?

Thanks to Guilherme () for taking us around Brazil.   

BEL√âM, BRAZIL - What an amazing city for food lovers - so many unique dishes, foods, ingredients from the Amazon, and so many amazingly friendly and hospitable people. This was one of the best days of my trip to Brazil. 

Ver-o-peso Market - One this Amazonian street food tour of Belem, we started at the market, one of the must visit attractions in the city. It‚Äôs all you could want in an Amazon market - full of freshwater fish, herbs, vegetables, and fruits out of control.

Jambu Cacha√ßa - After walking around the fish market section and seeing some of the amazingly brightly colored chilies, I was introduced to Jambu Cacha√ßa, Brazil‚Äôs sugarcane liquor spiced up seriously with jambu - an Amazon tongue numbing flower and leaves. Wow, it‚Äôs serious.

Beef soup - 6 BRL ($.155) - We stopped an a friendly man selling Brazil nuts, and right then, a lady came around selling soups for breakfast. We had a beef soup, very hearty and delicious. I tried the jambu flower for the first time, so strong and so good. We then ate some Brazil nuts, a superfood packed with nutrition.

Fruit juice - There‚Äôs nothing like Amazon fruits and here‚Äôs the juices we tried: Cupua√ßu, Cacao, Bacuri, Acerola

Box da Eliana e Kelly - And here‚Äôs where this Amazon street food tour in Brazil got out of control. Our friends in Belem had organised with Eliana, from Box da Eliana e Kelly to host us for an amazing Amazon food lunch, where all their friends at the market each cooked their speciality and brought it to the table. There was so much good food and so much love I could hardly believe it. Lots of the Belem Amazon foods contained tucupi (sauce from wild manioc), jambu flowers and leaves, and Pirarucu fish.

Thank you Eliana! None of the amazing Ladies would accept payment. Please go meet them in Bel√©m!

Tacac√° Da Diva - 4 pm is the best time in Belem to eat one of the most amazing street food in the city, and I would say one of the best street foods in Brazil - Tacac√°, I still can‚Äôt believe how good it is, and how it‚Äôs not loved all over the world! We also had Vatap√°. Price - 13 BRL ($3.35) per bowl

Ros√°rio Lanches - Finally to finish this Amazon street food tour of Belem, Brazil, we went to Ros√°rio Lanches, a legendary stall. We tried both their roasted pork let and their hot dog, both of which were incredibly delicious.

What am unforgettable day of Amazonian food in Bel√©m, Brazil. Thank you to everyone who made it happen and to everyone for preparing the amazing food.

WrSXLvg-ri0,TRAVEL Bloggers Are LIARS | The Truth About Traveling,"LIES.TRAVEL.BLOGGERS.TELL. YUP! I said it. Fight me!
Since everyone is a travel blogger now. It's a fight for who can make travel look the best so more people follow them. Travel is amazing and I love that it's a part of my life but there are HUGE gaps in the information and the assumed lifestyles of travel bloggers. (Even some of the ""successful ones""). So per usual, I decided to burst bubbles and share an unpopular opinion about the most omitted facts about traveling/travel blogging.

You mad? It's probably because you know I'm right.

I've been a full-time blogger / travel vlogger for 9 years and transformed myself into a full-time travel blogger in the past 3 years. I will teach you how to create a website, build a brand and get you setup on the path to getting paid to travel. When I first started out in 2016, I didn't have a clue about how to take a decent photo and forget about shooting video. Today, I'm proud to say I'm halfway decent as a photographer and videographer and have racked up 800k followers on social and 1.5 million views on YouTube.

// How Much Money Can You Make As a Travel Blogger?

Since starting my travel influencer account, I've earned more than $200,000 from a combination of affiliate commission, paid sponsors, adsense and selling my own products. This is definitely a career that if you work hard and build yourself up, you can easily quit your job and live your dreams.

// How to Make a Blog [2019] Focused on Travel Blogging

My advice for any new website is to use Wordpress. First of all, it's free, unlike SquareSpace which costs money to use and locks you into their hosting provider. With a Wordpress website, you can move it to any hosting provider (whether it be Bluehost or Hostgator when you first start out) or WPEngine when you really grow your blog and have a ton of traffic.

// How to Start a Blog and Become a Full Time Blogger

Setting up your first website should take no more than 15 minutes. Your steps are:

Pick your domain name
Sign up for your hosting plan
Install Wordpress
Install your theme
Start blogging
Setup your blog here for just $3.95:

// How to Write a Travel Blog

The really daunting task is shooting good photos and videos and telling stories as a travel blogger. I started out blogging not knowing a thing about how to shoot photos or videos but thanks to Youtube, I was able to teach myself everything I needed to learn. I suggest you do the same thing, start searching on YouTube and teach yourself.

In this video, I walk you through exactly what my steps are to starting and making money with your own travel blog.

I‚Äôve tried almost every possible Monetization strategy and these are my proven methods that work for me:

Affiliate marketing where you get paid a commission for selling something
Paid advertisements like Crest paying me to review their white strips
Adsense revenue which I get from people watching this video and clicking on ads on my website
Freelancing: taking photos, building websites or providing consulting to small businesses
Selling a product: I have a style guide I created last year and it sells a couple of copies every month

// my proven techniques as a full time travel blogger

// find your speciality
- Say you want to be a travel blogger, what‚Äôs one thing you‚Äôll bring on every trip that everyone needs? A great bag. Imagine you took a different bag on every trip and reviewed it as part of the vlog. I guarantee you‚Äôd be one of the few experts reviewing just bags and you‚Äôd be able to corner the market. And when you do your videos, it would be really hard for someone like me or anyone else to copy your knowledge base and expertise
- Besides travel bags you could also focus on bug spray, sunscreen, backup batteries, etc find something you‚Äôre interested in and own it

// This will be hard, but follow these tips to ensure you succeed

If you need any help creating your website and starting your travel vlog, let me know in the comments, I reply to every single one.

ZbhALpp3q,How To Find a Niche For Your Travel Blog or Instagram,"How To Find a Niche For Your Travel Blog or Instagram

When you think of your job as a travel blogger, it's ultimately to provide value to your readers. It's normal human behavior to want to talk about lots of different topics, but in order to be a successful travel blogger or influencer, you need to consider perfecting your niche. 

Think of all the successful travel bloggers you love and look up to. Are they talking about tons of different topic, or really zoning in on a few in particular? 9/10 - they have travel as the umbrella, but are focusing on 2 or 3 sub niches (adventure, culinary, motivation)

If you're using SEO tactics to drive traffic to your blog, you want to ensure that the person that comes to your blog for the first time, knows what to expect. If you have posts on motherhood, travel, fitness and fashion, you will most likely lose them as a loyal follower. While they may be interested in all these topics, they found your site via search, and are looking for more topics that cover this area. 

In today's video, I'll talk more about why getting niche will transform your travel blog or instagram, and tactics on how to get started!

Im2gVWc2-hU,TURKISH STREET FOOD : You've NEVER Seen this Before!!! KEBAB HEAVEN + Street Food in Izmir Turkey,"Kemeraltƒ± Bazaar Street Food tour in IZMIR, TURKEY

Welcome to the first episode of our Turkey street food series. historical KEMERALTI BAZAAR (Tarihi Kemeraltƒ± √áar≈üƒ±sƒ±)!

We start our street food tour at a famous ‚Äúb√∂rek√ßisi‚Äù for some savoury b√∂rek pastries. We ordered our b√∂rek with pastirma and cheese. It was very delicious and fun to watch the chef prepare the dish! (17 TRY / 2.92 USD)

Continuing through the ancient 7th century market, we find an extremely unique shop serving up an Izmir speciality Tur≈°u Suyu, which is pickle juice! Made up of simple ingredients to be sour, spicy and extremely refreshing. Pickle juice is best enjoyed in Izmir in the summer heat! (3 TRY / 0.52 USD)

For lunch, we try manisa kebap, hailing from the city of Manisa which is right outside of Izmir. The dish consists of kebab chunks, served on top of flatbread with a side of tomato sauce and yogurt. It is also covered in rich butter. So mouthwatering and very CHEAP! (32 TRY / 5.50 USD with unlimited tea)

Just outside of the market is the Izmir Clock Tower. It is considered the symbol of Izmir and shouldn‚Äôt be missed while you‚Äôre in the city. It is a great place to take in the views of the sea. 

We were craving something sweet and went back into the market for shambli, a semolina cake soaked in syrup, mixed with walnuts, filled with cream, and some are covered in crushed pistachio. This will give you a sugar HIGH! (regular 5 TRY / 0.86 USD + pistachio 6 TRY / 1.03 USD)

To wash it all down, Turkish coffee is like no other coffee in the world and many shops have their own unique way of making it. Turkish coffee is always unfiltered so expect it to be strong and full of silt. (7 TRY / 1.20 USD)

We made a quick stop for ‚Äúmacun‚Äù which is an Ottoman candy. It is made in the most traditional way and these vendors do not have 1 location.  (4 TRY / 0.69 USD)

For our final stop of the day, we had to eat some seafood because Izmir is quite famous for it‚Äôs fresh fish! We chose a midye dolma (translation: STUFFED MUSSELS) restaurant. These mussels are stuffed with spiced rice and locals squeeze lemon directly onto each and every mussel.These were the FRESHEST mussels we‚Äôve tried in all of Turkey! (14 TRY / 2.41 USD for half kilo)

EpTFQcD7bME,'Making' - the best way of learning science and technology | Manish Jain | TEDxPanaji,"Manish Jain an IIT Kanpur and Stanford University alumnus demonstrates with working models how science and technology can be made fun to teach and learn. In this talk he takes the audience on a journey of 'MAKING' as a process for learning. He firmly believes this approach can revolutionize learning since toys speak the language that children understand. Manish is an IIT Kanpur alumnus. A chance meeting with Padmashree Arvind Gupta triggered him to dive into the space of popular science education full-time. Manish currently heads Creative Learning Initiative (CLI) at IIT Gandhinagar which aims to provide an ideal space and environment to learn and understand concepts joyously. His goal is to ignite interest, inquisitive spirit, and scientific temper to nurture inherent creativity and passion for science and technology among all. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at ",science and technology

I never got confronted with this kind of violence - I was brought to the hospital and spend around 5 hours there.
It was at some point maybe also my fault as said in the video - but bad things can happen everywhere in the world. 

I was amazed by the great help I received afterwards from all the people around me - especially the argentine people have been so nice to me which actually makes me even love Argentina more!
I thank all of you guys for your kind words and support afterwards - with your help I'm now almost recovered and continue what I love to do: Traveling.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - In this food tour, Mina and I discovered authentic North Korean food in Seoul. Seoul is only 50 km from North Korea, and home to many North Koreans, some of whom have opened restaurants in the city. I‚Äôve been to Seoul many times, but never had any like these unique North Korean dishes before. Naengmyeon is known to be one of the most common North Korean foods, but we wanted to try a few other lesser known North Korean dishes as well.

Here are the North Korean restaurants we ate at on this food tour:

Dongmu Bapsang (ÎèôÎ¨¥Î∞•ÏÉÅ) - This is where you can order the giant platter of rainbow noodles, and I would strongly recommend it. They pour the soup tableside, and it‚Äôs such a refreshing dish. Additionally the Sundae, Korean blood sausage, was some of the best I‚Äôve ever had. Total price - 61,000 KRW ($51.63)

Hadan (ÌïòÎã®) - Situated just off the main road in an unassuming small house like building Hadan (ÌïòÎã®) specializes mostly in North Korean bowls of noodles and mandu dumplings. The food was very good, tasted handmade, and the restaurant feels very homely. The owner really warmed up to us, and as we left, even insisted that we take umbrellas. Total price - 44,000 KRW ($34.70)

Jinmi Pyongyang Naengmyeon (ÏßÑÎØ∏ÌèâÏñëÎÉâÎ©¥) - Finally, the third restaurant on this North Korean food tour of Seoul, we went to Jinmi Pyongyang Naengmyeon (ÏßÑÎØ∏ÌèâÏñëÎÉâÎ©¥) to eat Naengmyeon noodles, and this massive pan of beef hot pot with herbs. Total price - 104,000 KRW ($88.03) 

Overall, North Korean food seems very pure, some things with less flavor, a little more plain, yet still flavorful and focusing on the natural ingredients without extras. Taking this North Korean food tour of Seoul was a fun experience, especially hanging out and eating with Mina.

‚ñ∫Special offer on a Wordpress hosting plan: 

I often have people asking me questions about travel blogging or blogging in general, but it's difficult to give good advice in just a paragraph or even a few sentences. So I thought I'd share some more substantial thoughts on how to have the right mindset, expectations, and process to be successful in travel blogging. 5 years ago I benefited a lot from what others taught about blogging so, in turn, hopefully you will find my random thoughts useful in some way!

VERY SORRY for the focus moving in and out. My camera was having a bad day.

Find out more on the Migrating Miss Travel Blog - 

Orkney has a rich history, dating back to the Neolithic period. Skara Brae and other archeological excavations in Orkney are changing the way we look at history! You can also walk a huge stone circle, the 104 metre wide Ring of Brodgar. 

Don't miss the island of Hoy, and learning more about Orkney's role in both World Wars.

87If-Q2pJWQ,Philippines Street Food - AMAZING Filipino Food at Aling Sosing's Carinderia in Manila!,"One of the best Filipino food meals you can eat in Manila!
‚ñ∫Subscribe to my channel for more food videos: http://bit.ly/MarkWiensSubscribe

Aling Sosing's is often considered to be one of the best carinderias, or local Filipino food restaurants, in all of Manila. The crowd that shows up to eat lunch here everyday reinforces the fact that they are no doubt one of the spots you want to be in Manila, if you‚Äôre a food lovers. When I was eating in Manila, eating at Aling Sosing's was certainly among the best local Filipino food restaurants that I tried.

Aling Sosing's is a very typical type of local street food restaurant, sitting on the corner of a street, near to Makati. Just like most carinderias, all the food is prepared ahead of time, and sits at the front of the restaurant. When you arrive to order, you just simply pick and choose the different dishes that you want to order, find a table, and they will bring you the dishes to your table. Additionally, some of the famous dishes to eat at Aling Sosing's are off the grill, and you‚Äôll smell the wonderful aroma of the grilling meats the entire time you‚Äôre eating, and it‚Äôs fantastic.

Ying and I arrived about 11 am on a weekday, and luckily we beat the main lunch traffic, but just barely. There were tables available when we arrived, but as soon as we sat down and order it filled up. Sof if you eat at Aling Sosing's Carinderia you might want to arrive before the main lunch rush. Additionally, some of the Filipino food dishes sell out fast, and they don‚Äôt cook them again for the day - once they are sold out, they are done for the day.

Here are the main Filipino dishes I ordered:
Pinakbet - A stew of mixed vegetables, oftentimes flavored with shrimp paste. This was the best versions of pinakbet I‚Äôve ever had.
Inihaw na tilapia - The grilled tilapia is quite well known at this restaurant. It was simple and delicious.
Inihaw na liempo - The grilled pork belly is one of their signature dishes, and it‚Äôs every bit as good and smoky as it looks.
Kaldereta - A Filipino food I love so much is kaldereta, a goat stew, mainly because I love goat so much. It was oily, but really good.
Adobong pusit - I saw the squid the pot and decided to try it out. It was a little on the sweet side.
Pork BBQ - Fresh off the grill, Ying and I ordered some of their pork bbq. The pork was tender and lathered in bbq, it was amazing.

Total price - 640 PHP ($12.90)

If you‚Äôre looking for a local Filipino restaurant in Manila that I think serves some of the best Filipino food, Aling Sosing's is a restaurant you‚Äôre going to want to check out. The food is awesome, the setting and positive atmosphere is refreshing, and the constant smoke from the grill will keep your nose happy and wanting more!

I1QBHhbS0,Salzburg Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Salzburg.d180...

The Austrian city of Salzburg is situated on the northern edge of the Alps, close to the border of Germany. Surrounded by lakes and mountains, and straddling the banks of the Salzach River, few cities can match Salzburg‚Äôs fairytale setting.
 
Few places can match its musical heritage either. Salzburg is the hometown of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and provided the settings for one of cinema‚Äôs most-adored musicals, The Sound Of Music. 
  
Take the funicular to Hohensalzburg, one of Europe‚Äôs best-preserved medieval fortresses. Down below in the Old Town you‚Äôll find Salzburg Cathedral and the Salzburg Museum. Nearby, wander along narrow Getreidegasse, one of the loveliest shopping streets in the world. 
 
Just off the Old Market Square, savor 300 years of coffee-making tradition at Caf√© Tomaselli. For classical Austrian fare served with a side of Opera, take the short walk to Stiftskeller St. Peter. At the M√ºllner Br√§u Brewery, hang out with beer devotees from all over the world. 
 
Salzburg has long been a city where inspiration knows no bounds, especially when it comes to its palaces. Just a short stroll from the Marionette Theater, the grandeur of Mirabell Palace and Gardens awaits. While on Salzburg‚Äôs southern outskirts, explore the playful water features at Hellbrunn Palace.
 
While Salzburg abounds with fountains, some of the city‚Äôs most impressive water features are its natural ones, such as Lake Wolfgang and Krimml Waterfall. For a waterfall with a difference, visit the spa town of Bad Gastein, whose falls roar straight through the heart of town. From the town, take the cable car to the summit of Stubnerkogel Mountain and walk Europe‚Äôs highest suspension bridge.
 
The Salzburg region is full of surprises, so before heading back to the city, head underground, into the Hallein Salt Mine. From its salt mines to its symphonies, from its fountains to its waterfalls, Salzburg plays out like a living opera, filled with drama, comedy, intrigue and passion.",travel blogs

Miller gives a little history lesson of the death camps the Nazis used to intentionally and carefully exterminate the Jews. AOC‚Äôs ignorant, inflammatory remarks are a disgrace. Then, in the age of moral relativism, we are told by progressives that everything goes. Their push to decriminalize sex work is another example of progressive policies that do more harm to women and children than good.

UmF5il2bl8g,üé• Sri Lankan street food - Kottu Roti - Hoppers - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog Street Food,"üé• Sri Lankan Cooking - Kottu & Hoppers - Food Travel Blog - Sri Lanka Vlog Street Food One of several videos we filmed while in Sri Lanka, this video vlog was shot just outside Negombo. On our last night before moving on we stopped at a Kottu Hoppers place, you can hear in the video of this the incredible noise that is made when making Kottu as the two large scrappers hit the hotplate and chop the roti with vegetables and spices. Well that was our time in this villa, amazing. So in the morning we take a 3 hour drive east to Kandy, see you when we arrive. Kottu is Roti or a type of flat bread chopped with a sauce of some kind added in the mix. The sound of kottu being made really is the background music of Sri Lanka. Cooks chop out on a hot flat griddle the roti and then add in pretty much whatever you can think of. Chicken curry, Vegetable curry and so on are popular. As the cooks hit the griddle with what looks like big scrappers, the sound of metal on metal fills the air. We pulled up outside a Kottu house and ordered from the car. Chicken and Cheese was our choice and it was brought over as we sat in the minivan. Plenty of fresh chilli and crispy chicken soon left my plate and i am now ready to go back to the hotel, feeling totally satisfied with my day. See you in the morning. Hoppers (appam) are based on a fermented batter, usually made of rice flour and coconut milk with spices. The dish is pan-fried or steamed. The fermenting agent is palm toddy or yeast. Hopper variants can be either savory (such as egg hoppers, milk hoppers, and string hoppers), or sweet (such as vandu appa and pani appa). Savory hoppers are often accompanied by lunu miris, a mix of red onions and spices.Short eats are a variety of snacks that are bought by the dozen from ""short eat"" shops and restaurants. These are eaten on the go, mainly for breakfast or during the evening. Short eats include pastries, Chinese rolls and patties. A popular short eat among Tamils is the mutton roll, made from tender pieces of mutton with potato and seasoned with spices. This can be a very spicy dish. Mutton rolls are served all over the world wherever there are Sri Lankan Tamils.
Kottu is a spicy stir-fry of shredded roti bread with vegetables. Optional ingredients include eggs, meat, or cheese. It was invented in Batticaloa and literally means 'chopped roti' in Tamil.  -  -  -  -  -  -  - 
Pol sambola (coconut sambol) is a traditional Sri Lankan dish made from coconut, mostly used as an accompaniment with rice, string hoppers, hoppers, and many more meals. Sri Lankan cuisine has been shaped by many historical, cultural, and other factors.",travel blogs

K-RSpEbiex8,7 Biggest Lies Told In History Books,"Subscribe! https://goo.gl/JTfP6L

When someone asks us a question ‚ÄúWhat do we really know about our world?‚Äù we might as well reply everything or nothing. And both these answers are wrong and right at the same time. We in Smart Banana want to scour through every page of history books and prove that some facts aren‚Äôt facts at all, they are LIES! 

Confused? Of course, we know some things, pieces of general information about the universe, historical events, and personalities. However, when it comes to facts and dates from the past we rely only on one kind of source - history books. Some of us believe that the information we can find in there can‚Äôt be 100% trusted, because, let‚Äôs put this straight, some of the facts are really doubtful.

46Fslwmuj,NIGHT MARKET FOOD in Manila Philippines: BBQ & BLOOD STEW,"My last night in Manila Philippines and I really wanted to try out one of the local popular night market for some night time eats. One of my local friends suggested Central Mercado a wonderfully vibrant night market in the heart of Manila.

The night market first of all, smelled incredible. From the roasted meat skewers to the refreshing local drinks, there was something for everyone at this night market.

Having filled up on great eats at this night market, I proceeded to a local restaurant that many locals recommended for a taste of Dinuguan which is essentially pork blood stew with organ meat inside.

In this video we explore why modern art seems to suggest that modern civilization is suffering from a spiritual sickness - a deep existential loneliness, an eruption of the demonic, a negation of human nature and a fragmentation of the human form, a celebration of chaos - and thus perhaps, even a ‚Äúsickness unto death‚Äù.",art and music

Lyrics of some songs:

""Mon couer s'ouvre √† ta voix""  (Camilie Saint-Saens)
Mon c≈ìur s'ouvre √† ta voix,
comme s'ouvrent les fleurs
aux baisers de l'aurore!
Mais, √¥ mon bienaim√©,
pour mieux s√©cher mes pleurs,
que ta voix parle encore!
Dis-moi qu'√† Dalila
tu reviens pour jamais.
Redis √† ma tendresse
les serments d'autrefois,
ces serments que j'aimais!
|: Ah! r√©ponds, r√©ponds √† ma tendresse!
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse! :|

Ainsi qu'on voit des bl√©s
les √©pis onduler
sous la brise l√©g√®re,
ainsi fr√©mit mon coeur,
pr√™t √† se consoler,
√† ta voix qui m'est ch√®re!
La fl√®che est moins rapide
√† porter le tr√©pas,
que ne l'est ton amante
√† voler dans tes bras!
|: Ah! r√©ponds √† ma tendresse!
Verse-moi, verse-moi l'ivresse! :|
Samson! Samson! Je t'aime!



""De' Miei Bollenti Spiriti"" (Giuseppe Verdi)
Lunge da lei per me non v'ha diletto!
Volaron gi√† tre lune
Dacch√© la mia Violetta
Agi per me lasci√≤, dovizie, amori
E le pompose feste,
Ove, agli omaggi avvezza,
Vedea schiavo ciascun di sua bellezza.
Ed or contenta in questi ameni luoghi
Tutto scorda per me.
Qui presso a lei io rinascer mi sento,
E dal soffio d'amor rigenerato
Scordo ne'gaudii suoi tutto il passato.

De' miei bollenti spiriti
Il giovanile ardore
Ella tempr√≤ col placido
Sorriso dell'amor, dell'amor!
Dal d√¨ che disse:
Vivere io voglio io voglio a te fedel,
Dell'universo immemore
Io vivo, io vivo quasi,
Io vivo quasi in ciel.

Dal d√¨ che disse:
Vivere io voglio a te fedel,
Ah s√¨‚Ä¶dell'universo immemore
Io vivo, io vivo quasi,
Io vivo quasi in ciel.
Io vivo in ciel.
Dell'universo immemore.
Io vivo quasi in ciel.
Ah s√¨, io vivo quasi in cielo. 
Io vivo quasi in ciel.



""Apri la Tua Finestra"" (Pietro Mascagni)
Apri la tua finestra!
Jor son io
Che vengo al tuo chiamar,
Povera Dhia!
Apri la tua finestra
Al raggio mio!
Apri il tuo cor
A mia calda mal√¨a!
Jor ha ascoltata, o Dhia,
La tua preghiera!
Apri l'anima tua,
Fanciulla, al Sole!
Apri l'anima tua alle mie parole!
Apri il tuo cuore a me,
Fanciulla, e spera!
Tu vuoi morir?
Morire io ti far√≤
Ma ti far√≤ morir dal Sol baciata,
Poscia al paese eterno ti trarr√≤...
Ove, o fanciulla,
Tu sarai amata!

Village food in Pakistan is AMAZING! Today, we're going DEEP into the countryside of Pakistan to try local village cooking, trying a DELICIOUS Chicken curry made by grandma, and a huge Pakistani village LUNCH!

Today,  I'm (The Food Ranger, Trevor James) taking you for a RARE VILLAGE FOOD feast with my friends Saim and Ali! We drove out to Saim's hometown village in the countryside of Pakistan for some extremely delicious home cooking village style! 

‚ñ∫3 Months FREE on ExpressVPN and 49% OFF! 

Village food in Pakistan is very delicious, perhaps even more delicious than street food in Pakistan! One of the most unique foods in this food video in Pakistan we tried was the saag spinach and mustard curry combined with the COW DUNG FUEL tandoor oven that cooked the paratha in!

In this village cooking video, Granny is cooking up a ton of local specialties, and we are going for a village tour to see how the locals live! We ride a buffalo, visit the cow dung drying area, and taste some of the local well water!

When we arrived in Saim's family village, one of the things that really struck me is how happy everyone is. The local way of life is very relaxing and calming! We were invited to his home and watched Saim's granny cooking up all of her village secrets! The Pakistani village recipes were amazing to taste! This was the trip of a lifetime!

We watched Saim's granny preparing paratha and also some corn flour paratha, SUPER TASTY chicken curry prepared by granny, and also some amazing desserts too! Watching it all was breathtaking!

Thanks so much for watching!

I hope you're enjoying this big Pakistani street food video series! Thanks so much for watching, I would love to hear from you down below!

There is much more street food in our Pakistani food videos series, get ready for the playlist of a lifetime!!

""Never There"" Live acoustic version by Art and Music
Don't waste my time 
Darling I can hear
I‚Äôve always been weird I just needed you there
Just needed you there

I‚Äôve gone away and I‚Äôm not coming back
By this time next year so just forget that you care
And go back all those years

What makes you cry 
Did playtime pass you by
Always living in fear that you were never there
Well you were never there

I‚Äôve gone away and I‚Äôm not coming back
By this time next year so just forget that you care
And go back all those years
A time I can‚Äôt recall I‚Äôm told it happened in fall
We headed north up the coast your face turned white as a ghost
The restaurant stopped for a show but momma didn't back down

You‚Äôre gonna hate this song when I bury you in the ground
You'll hate this song when I bury you in the ground
You in the ground
You in the ground
You in the ground

jBQJFBV5eyE,NutraBio Investing in You: All new BcGMP manufacturing facility launching July 1!,"Big Announcement!!! So NutraBio is in the midst of a full renovation of our cGMP manufacturing facility. A top to bottom complete overhaul of the facility with the sole purpose of improving the quality and efficacy of our supps. We‚Äôve closed down manufacturing until July 1st as we undergo the most comprehensive facility upgrade that we‚Äôve ever undertaken.

NutraBio was already a legit cGMP manufacturing facility so why would we do this. Well, most companies do something like this in response to shortcomings in an FDA audit and after I first posted about the renovations, I was challenged on that point. But we just finished a 3 week FDA cGMP inspection and if you read my post about it, you know that we made it through the full inspection without a single 483 observance. That means the FDA found no shortcomings in our processes that required improvement. Why do people think that positive action is always in response to negative action? It reminds of when we started publishing 3rd-Party test results for every batch of supps we manufacture. Everyone thought we must have gotten caught failing label claim so we did it as a public relations stunt. No, our products never failed, we did it because it‚Äôs the right thing to do for our customers. People should know exactly what‚Äôs in their supps and I make sure they do.

So back to the question, why would I do this comprehensive upgrade of my facility if I don‚Äôt have to? I‚Äôve always found that people act for one of two reasons: inspiration or desperation. In this case it not desperation since no regulatory agency is forcing me to do it. I have to say its inspiration. Every day I read messages and posts from all of you and I get inspired by what you say. For those of you who don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about, just go to our BioCrew page on Facebook and you‚Äôll understand. So many of you trying to better your lives and trusting my team and I to do our part. That trust is a responsibility that I do not take lightly. So when I see ways that I can improve my supplements I feel compelled to act. There was nothing wrong with my previous facility, I would have put it up against any other in the country, but if I can improve quality I must do it.

When we‚Äôre finished, we‚Äôll no longer be a cGMP facility ‚Äì we‚Äôre moving up to a new category: BcGMP facility... Beyond cGMP!!!! My promise to you is the same as it was when I started NutraBio 23 years ago: to give you the best damn supplements I possibly can! That is the challenge I give my team and myself every single day, and it is my solemn promise to you.

So BioCrew, thank you for your support and inspiration, this is for you and I hope you‚Äôll come visit us when we‚Äôre finished. I‚Äôll personally give you a tour!",manufacturing

zSHcyXfNP,Iceland Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"With a population of only 300,000, Iceland can feel like the most isolated place on earth, yet its capital Reykjavik, is only a three-hour flight from London and just under six from New York.
 
Reykjavik is relaxed and welcoming, yet possesses a cultural life that holds its own against other European capitals. Most buildings are built simple and low to beat the North Atlantic winds. However, the city is also graced with grand civic architecture inspired by Iceland‚Äôs natural beauty, such as the soaring central tower of Hallgr√≠mskirkja.
 
Many of the country‚Äôs most popular sights are within easy reach of Reykjav√≠k. Immerse yourself in the spirit of Iceland, at the Blue Lagoon. Then spend a day or two in The Golden Circle, an area which encompasses three of Iceland‚Äôs greatest natural wonders; Thingvellir National Park, the Geysir Geothermal Field, and Gullfoss.
 
Iceland‚Äôs main ring road strings together an endless series of epic landscapes. Less than two hours drive east of Reykjavik are two of the world‚Äôs most beautiful waterfalls, Seljalandsfoss and Sk√≥gafoss. Continue eastward towards V√≠k, Iceland‚Äôs southern-most village, where you‚Äôll find the dramatic landscapes of Black Beach, Reynisdrangar, and Dyrholaey. Follow the ring road for another two hours into the ethereal light of J√∂kuls√°rl√≥n Lake, where icebergs break away from Europe‚Äôs largest glacier and float for years before tumbling out to sea.
 
Head north and feel the earth rumble at Europe‚Äôs mightiest waterfall, Dettifoss. Then explore the Myvatn region, a tranquil lake surrounded by nature in all its violent beauty. Take a careful walk through the boiling landscape of Namafjall, lose yourself amid the lava pillars of Dimmuborgir, and peer into the caldera of Krafla Volcano.
 
Known as the Capital of the North, Akureyri is the perfect place to warm up and enjoy some creature comforts, before heading off into the wilds again. In Iceland, every side road is a story waiting to unfold. So come, and live your own Icelandic story, it‚Äôs one you‚Äôll keep telling for the rest of your days.

6pxxS07PZn0,In Search Of History - Charles Ponzi & His Scheme (History Channel Documentary),"This episode was converted from an old VHS tape that had considerable wear and tear, resulting in poor audio quality. Unfortunately it's the only copy I've been able to obtain so far.
__________________________
Narrated by David Ackroyd

Charles Ponzi became known in the early 1920s as a swindler in North America for his money-making scheme. He promised clients a 50% profit within 45 days, or 100% profit within 90 days, by buying discounted postal reply coupons in other countries and redeeming them at face value in the United States as a form of arbitrage. 

In reality, Ponzi was paying earlier investors using the investments of later investors. His scheme ran for over a year before it collapsed, costing his ""investors"" $20 million.

While this type of fraudulent investment scheme was not originally invented by Ponzi, it became so identified with him that it now is referred to as a Ponzi scheme.

MRI8ffYKA8,Vienna Vacation Travel Guide | Expedia,"https://www.expedia.com/Vienna.d17831...

On your next trip to Austria, pay a visit to its capital city of Vienna. During the late 19th and early 20th century, this city became a cultural epicenter of Europe, contributing art, philosophy, and culture on its way to becoming one of the world‚Äôs great cities.

During your Vienna sightseeing, you can drink coffee in the same cafes as Einstein and Freud, or wander down the streets that inspired Beethoven. Tour galleries devoted to some of the most magnificent artwork in all of Europe, then walk along the Ringstrasse. Also called ‚ÄúRing Road,‚Äù this downtown boulevard home to private residences, palaces, and other exquisite examples of architecture for you to marvel at. 

Much of Vienna tourism is centered in its cafes. This is not just because its residents love strong coffee‚Äîthough they do‚Äîbut because Viennese social life largely grows out of its coffee houses. Locals will spend hours at their favorite cafes, reading the paper, speaking to friends, working on projects, or listening to music in the evenings. Sit at a table and watch the people of Vienna stroll by, or enjoy a sachertorte, or chocolate cake, while catching up on your latest novel. It‚Äôs impossible to visit this city and not be inspired.

Vienna has long been called The City of Music. Find out why at the Vienna State Opera; a backstage tour will show you all the ins and outs of this majestic place, as well as give you a glimpse of why it has been at the forefront of entertainment since its construction in the 1800s. Afterward, head a few blocks south to the Volksgarten, or people‚Äôs garden. Stroll through its pathways and sniff the sweet fragrance of its hundreds of roses. What better way to end a day in one of the world‚Äôs most beautiful cities? 

What was your favorite part of Vienna?

1iPm_eiQI,Engineering and Music: A Powerful Duet for Art and Science - Science Nation,"University of Rochester electrical engineer Mark Bocko has combined his passion for music with his passion for engineering, devising a way to digitally reproduce music in files 1,000 times smaller than an mp3! But along with this new type of compression, Bocko's team of engineers and musicians at Rochester's Eastman School of Music are also helping uncover some extraordinarily precise details about just how music is made. With support from the National Science Foundation, they have built a computer model of the clarinet, entirely from real world acoustical measurements taken from human musicians. Measuring such things as how hard the musician is blowing into the instrument and the pressure the musician applies to the reed, they have modeled the way music is made. Their work could evolve into a cool new tool for music teachers and help create more expressive, more emotional computer generated musical sounds.

‚ñ∫ Subscribe to Delhi Food Walks: https://www.youtube.com/user/Delhifoo...

If you love to indulge in regional cuisines then this episode might come handy in engaging you with the culinary collage of one of the most popular South Indian cuisines, the Telugu cuisine that is known for its spicy and tangy flavours. It is native to the Telugu speaking population from the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana and has three distinct categories-the coastal Andhra cuisine, the Rayalaseema cuisine and the Telangana cuisine- that have been shaped by the varied topographical influences.

In case of cereals, rice is a staple of the irrigated Andhra region and also Rayalseema too. Ragi is very popular in Rayalseema. In the semi arid Telengana, millet-based breads (roti) are predominant. The cooking techniques are also diverse in all the three regions. Across all zones we noticed a liberal use of spices in the food. 
Meat and seafood (coastal areas) feature prominently on the menus while dal (lentils)is also a common dish in the veg section. Tomatoes, coconut, chilies and tamarind are generously used in curries. Spicy and hot pickles and chutneys are common accompaniments in the Telugu cuisine.
So let‚Äôs get started with this enlightening gastronomic exploration with our amazing  host Sankalp Vishnu  as we brace ourselves to savour and discuss some of the popular traditional delicacies of the Telugu cuisine. We visited three celebrated restaurant that have earned the fame for serving the best and authentic versions of these respective cuisines in Hyderabad.

For Andhra cuisine we went to The Spicy Venue at Jubilee hills. Here we met  the owner Sampath who introduced us to this cuisine and over the due course of the meal, shared many insightful details about it. The spread here was extensive, spicy and tangy but super delicious. We started with pain plain Rice and ghee which was the staple and then moved onto the popular traditional veg and non veg dishes. The feast ended with the most delectable apricot dessert  that we had ever tasted. 

Our next destination was Rayalseema Ruchulu where we tried some of the traditional Rayalseema delicacies. The curries were quite similar in flavour to the Andhra ones though there was a notable difference in the spice quotient and the sourness aspect of the two cuisines. All the curries and chutneys were mostly paired with either Ragi Sangati or Jonne Rotte. The bottle gourd halwa is the popular dessert from this region. The food here was equally scrumptious.

Finally Sankalp took us to Mercure hotel on the eve of Telangana Foundation day to try the authentic Telangana spread that was being showcased there on this special occasion. The chef in charge introduced us to the popular dishes from the region. We then had a hearty meal along with the palm wine, a traditional alcoholic drink native to this region. The sweet dishes included the arise and rava ladoo.

We extend our heartfelt gratitude to all our hosts including our gastronomic partner Sankalp bhai. This cultural connection through the regional culinary traditions wouldn‚Äôt have been possible without their hospitality, support and cooperation.
